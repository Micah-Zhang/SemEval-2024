Question  1
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Tom is a clean freak but he never dries his hair after a shower. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'He tries to stand upside down druing shower to avoid rain.', 'This man is bald.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald." because if Tom is a clean freak but never dries his hair after a shower, it can be inferred that he doesn't have any hair to dry. This is the most logical explanation for his behavior, as someone with hair would typically want to keep it clean and dry. Therefore, the fact that he never dries his hair suggests that he doesn't have any hair to dry, making the answer "This man is bald" the most plausible explanation.
Question: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This answer makes the most sense because it explains how the woman could have "shot" her husband, held him underwater (in a darkroom's chemical bath), and then "hung" him (to dry as a photograph) without actually harming him. This explanation aligns with the actions described in the question and does not involve any illegal or impossible scenarios.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: David's birthday is in December, but it is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia" because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December is actually in the summer season. Therefore, even though David's birthday is in December, it is not in the winter because of the geographic location of Australia.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'He was on a motorcycle.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because a person on a motorcycle can take a bend with just two wheels on the pavement, as it is a common maneuver for motorcycles. The other answer choices do not provide a valid explanation for the situation described.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.

Question  2
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother" because this scenario is possible if the sisters all have the same brother, meaning there is only one brother in the family. This would make a total of seven children (6 daughters and 1 brother), along with the parents, totaling nine family members. This explanation fits within the constraints of the given information and is the most logical solution.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke."

This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Since the entire house is described as single-story, it is logical to assume that there are no stairs present. This answer aligns with the given information and makes the most sense in the context of a single-story house.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional car that is neither a red or a blue.', 'Mrs.Smith has one car that is blue and red at the same time.', 'Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.

Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: Two fathers and two sons went fishing one day. They were there the whole day and only caught 3 fish. One father said, that is enough for all of us, we will have one each. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sons shared the same fish.', "There was the father, his son, and his son's son.", 'One father gave his fish to his son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was the father, his son, and his son's son." This is the best answer because there were actually only three people fishing: the grandfather (a father), his son (a father), and his grandson (a son). Therefore, when they caught three fish, each of them could have one fish. This is possible because the grandfather is a father and a son, and the son is a father and a son as well.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'This man is bald.', 'This man walk upside down to avoid rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald" because if Samuel is bald, then he wouldn't have any hair on his head to get wet in the rain. This explains how his clothes got soaked but not a single hair on his head got wet. This is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Three doors are present. Every door has a way to exit. The first door has lava and fire inside. Lions behind the second door haven't eaten in five years. There is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator inside the third door. Which door will you probably get through? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died." This is the best answer because it offers the safest option for exiting the door. The other doors present immediate dangers, such as lava and fire in the first door and a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator in the third door. Since the lions have not eaten in 5 years, it is highly unlikely that they would still be alive, making it the most logical and safe choice.
Question: Three doors are present. Every door has a way to exit. The first door has lava and fire inside. Lions behind the second door haven't eaten in five years. There is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator inside the third door. Which door will you probably get through? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it" because if the first door is already destroyed and the fire is visible, it means that the danger inside has already passed and it is safe to exit through that door. The other options present immediate dangers, such as lions that may still be alive and an alligator at the bottom of a 1,000-foot drop. Therefore, the first door, being already destroyed, offers the most logical and safe way to exit.

Question  4
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Single-story houses are designed without multiple floors, so it is not common for them to have stairs. This answer makes the most sense in the context of the given scenario and is the most accurate choice.
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, the concept of stairs does not apply to a single-story house. This provides a clear and logical explanation for why the color of the stairs is not relevant to the scenario described.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption.', 'All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The airplane required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption." This is the best answer because turbulence can cause disruptions in electrical signals, including those transmitting music to Linda's headphones. No other answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the sudden interruption and subsequent resumption of the music.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['John wanted to be a photographer.', 'John wants to be a video game designer  and his parent are addicted to vedio gams.', "The parents known John was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.

Question  5
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: On July 4, a girl traveled to the United States to party for three days before returning on July 4. How did she manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'July 7th is holiday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it logically explains how the girl was able to party in the United States for three days before returning on July 4. This answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible explanation for the girl's travel plans. None of the other answer choices offer a practical or realistic explanation for how the girl managed to party in the United States for three days before returning on the same date.
Question: A guy goes to a football stadium for each time their team has a match, and yet he is left with a lot of money at the end of the year. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is the craziest fan of that football team.', 'He is the coach of the football team.', 'He got his money from the football players to appreciate his support.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is the coach of the football team." This is the best answer because as the coach, he would not have to pay for tickets to enter the stadium for each match, and he may also receive a salary or compensation for his role. This would explain why he has a lot of money left at the end of the year despite attending all the matches.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Two women and two doctors enter an ice cream shop. Each of them orders an ice cream cone. When their ice cream arrives, there is just one strawberry, one chocolate, and one vanilla flavor. Why didn't they complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["One of them is kind and didn't complain even though the shop forgets hers.", 'One of the women was a doctor.', "The ice creams are big enough for more than one people, so the shop think they won't complain.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the women was a doctor." This is because it implies that the presence of a doctor in the group may have influenced their decision not to complain. Doctors are often perceived as compassionate and understanding, and the presence of a doctor may have discouraged the others from making a fuss over the limited ice cream flavors.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.
Question: One morning a man is leaving on a business trip and finds he left some paperwork at his office. He runs into his office to get it and the night watchman stops him and says, "Sir, don't get on the plane. I had a dream last night that the plane would crash and everyone would die!" The man takes his word and cancels his trip. Sure enough, the plane crashes and everyone dies. The next morning the man gives the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life and then fires him. Why did he fire the watchman that saved his life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The watchman was fired for not warning the man in advance.', 'The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.', 'The man thought one thousand dollars is too much for a reward.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job" because the man gave the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life, indicating that he was grateful for the warning. However, the watchman's primary job was to keep watch and ensure the security of the building, not to be asleep on the job. The man likely fired the watchman for negligence in carrying out his duties, rather than for the warning about the plane crash.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: A guy embarks on a voyage between Mexico and the United States. He makes $300,000 from his trip despite not stopping at any ports or even leaving the stateroom. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a captain though he forgot to carry the passengers.", "He's a smuggler.", 'He got his tip from a rich passenger.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a smuggler" because the scenario describes a situation where the guy is making a large sum of money without stopping at any ports or leaving the stateroom, indicating that he is engaging in illegal activities such as smuggling. The other answer choices do not adequately explain how the guy could make $300,000 without leaving the stateroom or stopping at any ports.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A man buys a rope from a woman for $3.00 and hands the woman a $10 bill. The woman goes into the grocery store next door to get change. She returns and gives the man $7.00. After the man leaves, the clerk from the store comes and says, "Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me." The woman gives the clerk a good bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven dollars.', 'Seven dollars plus the rope.', 'Thirteen dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Seven dollars plus the rope." The woman initially received $10 for the rope, but ended up giving $7 in change and the rope back to the man. When the counterfeit bill was discovered, she had to give a good bill to the store clerk, resulting in a loss of the counterfeit bill ($10), the $7 in change, and the value of the rope ($3), totaling a loss of $20. Therefore, the woman lost seven dollars plus the value of the rope.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $35. Adding the cost of the perfume ($5), the total loss for the woman is $40. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" is the most accurate representation of the woman's loss in this situation.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Fifteen dollars" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $15. She did not lose the cost of the perfume in this scenario, as the counterfeit bill was the only financial loss for the woman. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars" accurately represents the woman's loss in this situation.

Question  6
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A girl finds a door, opens it, after sometime her body is found dead how is that possible since nobody shot her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the girl's body was found dead without being shot. Opening the door of an airplane in mid-flight would result in depressurization, leading to a rapid drop in altitude and causing her body to be found dead. This scenario aligns with the given information and provides a logical explanation for the girl's death.
Question: Stranger: Is your dog biting? 
Farmer: No. 
The dog suddenly attacks the stranger on the leg. Nonetheless, the farmer was speaking the truth! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', "It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog." This is because the farmer never claimed that the dog attacking the stranger was his own. The question asked if the farmer's dog was biting, and his response was simply "No." The attack could have been carried out by another dog, making the farmer's statement technically truthful. Therefore, the best answer is that it was not the farmer's dog responsible for the attack.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: Four cars come to a four way stop, all coming from a different direction. They can't decide who got there first, so they all go forward at the same time. They do not crash into each other, but all four cars go. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Their cars have different heights that can drive beyond each other.', 'They all made right-hand turns.', 'They decided to drive reversely with their rears forward first.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They all made right-hand turns." This is the best answer because if all four cars made right-hand turns, they would have been able to go forward without crashing into each other. Making right-hand turns would have allowed them to move in a clockwise direction around the intersection, avoiding a collision. Therefore, this is the most logical explanation for how all four cars were able to go forward at the same time without crashing.
Question: One woman placed a quick delivery pizza order, and it was delivered the following year. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in the delivery. By specifying that the order was meant for New Year's Day, it makes sense that the pizza was delivered the following year. This answer provides a logical and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: There are five apples in a basket. You distribute them among the five girls, giving each one an apple while leaving one apple in the basket. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket" because it is the most logical solution to ensure all five girls receive an apple. By giving the fifth girl her apple in the basket, all the apples are distributed and each girl receives one, while also leaving one apple in the basket. This resolves the initial problem without requiring any unlikely scenarios such as sharing or returning the apple.
Question: There was a man who everybody called Batman he knew nothing about bats and thought they were gross. He still loved it when people called him Batman! How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." because it suggests that the man might have earned the nickname "Batman" due to his exceptional skills or achievements in baseball. This would explain why he loved being called Batman, despite his dislike for bats, as it would be associated with something positive and admirable. None of the other answer choices provide a clear and logical explanation for his enjoyment of the nickname.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: Every two weeks a woman sits down and writes two words on 60 sheets of paper. Why does she do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her hand writing.', 'The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks.', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks." This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific action of writing two words on 60 sheets of paper every two weeks - signing her employees' paychecks. It also accounts for the regular bi-weekly nature of the task and the specific quantity of paper. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a specific and logical explanation for the woman's behavior.
Question: A knock on the door is heard by the woman while she is seated in her hotel room. When she opens the door, she is greeted by a stranger. I'm sorry, I made a mistake; I thought this was my room, he apologizes. He then exits the elevator and walks down the hall. The woman returns to her room and makes a security call. What gave the woman cause to be so wary of the man? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman knows this man on the newspaper.', 'If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.\n', 'The woman thought the man is rude.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first." This is the best answer because it shows that the man's behavior was suspicious and not consistent with someone trying to enter their own room. Instead of trying to enter with his key, he knocked on the door, which raised the woman's suspicion and prompted her to make a security call.
Question: Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee." This is the best answer because it explains the situation in a logical and plausible way. It accounts for the man's actions of pushing the vehicle and his realization of being bankrupt upon arriving at the hotel. It also provides a scenario where the man's financial situation is directly relevant to his predicament, making it the most fitting explanation.
Question: An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case? Choose the best answer choice.

Question  7
Question: Four men sat down to play, They played all night till the break of day. They played for gold and not for fun, With separate scores for every one. When they had come to square accounts, They all had made quite fair amounts. Can you explain the paradox, If no one lost, how all could gain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because the paradox described in the riddle can only be resolved if the men were playing musical instruments and making music, rather than engaging in a game of chance or skill like poker or mining for gold. In this case, they would have played music and earned money through their performance, allowing them all to make fair amounts without anyone losing.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Question  8
Question: There were a group of people including artists, doctors, and nurses all in a flight. The flight crashed before getting to the destination but no man was injured nor died. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The flight crashed in a remote and uninhabited area with no witnesses.', 'All the passengers were skilled in crash survival.', 'All the people on the flight were female.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All the people on the flight were female." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and reasonable explanation for why no one was injured or died in the crash. If all the people on the flight were female, then it would not be possible for "no man" to be injured or die in the crash. Therefore, this answer effectively solves the riddle provided.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Two men are found dead in their house, however there is no sign of one of them killing the other one, neither the sign of any other intruders. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were frightened to death by the sound of thunder and lightning.', "They're twins, and their genes let them die together.", 'They both comitted suiside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They both committed suicide." This is because it explains the possibility of two men found dead in their house without signs of one killing the other or any other intruder. Suicide by both individuals would account for their deaths without any external involvement. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical solution to the mystery.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.
Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine would have the capability to intentionally sink a ship without the need for a storm or mechanical issue. This explanation is also supported by the fact that the ship sank in front of onlookers and that there were no unusual circumstances such as too many fish or too many spectators in the harbor. Therefore, the presence of a submarine seems like the most logical explanation for the ship's sudden sinking.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass.

It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.

Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.

Question  9
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is carrying three pieces of gold each piece weighing one kilogram. While taking a walk he comes to a bridge that has a sign posted saying the bridge could hold only a maximum of 80 kilograms. John weighs 78 kilograms and the gold weighs three kilograms.

When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he juggled the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because by juggling the gold, Johnny was able to have only one or two pieces on the bridge at any given time, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeded the limit of 80 kilograms. Therefore, he was able to safely cross the bridge with all the gold.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a creative and unexpected twist to the question, as the typical assumption would be related to the physical environment or the characteristics of the women. By stating that they didn't get sunburnt because they were all married, it adds a humorous and unexpected element to the answer, making it the best choice.
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']

Question: Apricot Jam was being made by Morgan. She stirred the apricots in the pot after adding them all. It was then that she realized she needed to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots! How did she calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is an execellent chef.', 'She is good at physicis.', 'She counted the pits of apricots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She counted the pits of apricots." This is the best answer because in order to determine the appropriate amount of lemon juice, Morgan needed to know the number of apricots she had added to the pot. By counting the pits of the apricots, she could easily determine the correct amount of lemon juice to add based on the ratio of 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots.
Question: Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison need time to dissolve.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison was in the ice.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is the best answer because if Juliana drank five drinks with the same poison and did not die, then the poison must have been in something that Maria consumed and Juliana did not. Since they ordered the same drink, the only plausible explanation is that the poison was in the ice that was used in Maria's drink. This is supported by the fact that Juliana drank five of the same drinks without ingesting the poison.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

The other answer choices are not relevant or plausible explanations for the situation.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: A certain large animal lives happily and thrives here on Earth. One day, every single one of these writers is wiped out by a mysterious disease that affects only this particular animal. There are none left anywhere on earth -- they are all gone. About a year or so later, they begin to reappear on Earth again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the mule" because mules are born sterile, so they cannot reproduce naturally. This means that if every single mule were to be wiped out, there would be no way for them to reappear on Earth without human intervention to crossbreed donkeys and horses. Therefore, the reappearance of mules on Earth after being wiped out is not possible without human intervention.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Since the entire house is described as single-story, it is logical to assume that there are no stairs present. This answer aligns with the given information and makes the most sense in the context of a single-story house.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.

Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks.

Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss.

Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.

Question  11
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: Although they were born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were not born in the same year.', 'One student ran away from home at a young age.', 'One student had a bad academic grades and broken up with his parents.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were not born in the same year." This is because it is the most logical explanation for two students who are otherwise unrelated to share the same birthday. It is entirely conceivable that two unrelated students could be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, especially in a large school with many students. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for this situation is that the students were born on the same day of the same month but in different years.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.
How did he die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', "The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without the need for weapons or suicide. It also fits the clue of the sealed envelope on the desk in front of him. The other options do not fit the evidence as well as the poison in the envelope.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the possibility of a stone growing and producing fruit, by explaining that the "stone" was actually a seed. The explanation about the seed of a cherry being called a stone provides a logical and scientific explanation for the phenomenon, making it the most plausible and accurate option.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: How is it possible for a man to have a long beard while sharing multiple times per day? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a barber.", "The man's beard grows in a crazy speed.", 'He wants his girlfriend to buy him a razor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a barber." This is because as a barber, he is likely to have a long beard as it is a common practice within the industry. As part of his profession, he may share multiple times per day while still maintaining a long beard due to the nature of his work. This answer aligns with both logical reasoning and real-world examples of individuals in the barbering profession.
Question: How can a man who shaves several times a day still sport a long beard?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a barber.", "The man's beard grows in a crazy speed.", 'He wants his girlfriend to buy him a razor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a barber." This is the best answer because as a barber, he could be constantly shaving other people's beards, which would require him to shave several times a day. Despite this, he can still sport a long beard because he chooses not to shave his own beard. This explanation makes the most sense and is the most logical reason for a man to shave several times a day yet still have a long beard.
Question: A boy had just finished getting ready for his prom, shaving, applying cologne, and there would be an after-party. His parents had told him to be home for the next sunrise, but he arrived with a full-grown beard instead. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.', 'He went crazy with friends in that unnormal party.', 'His beard grows in an amazing speed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months." This is the best answer because in some parts of Alaska, the sun does not set for several months during the summer, resulting in continuous daylight. Therefore, when the boy arrived home, it had been several months since he left, allowing his beard to grow in that time. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the boy's sudden beard growth.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: There were twenty boys with different names in the classroom, All went up to the blackboard and wrote names on the board, however, there was only one name on the board, how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other boys don't have names.", 'All is the name of one of the boys.', "Other boys don't know how to write.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All is the name of one of the boys." This is the best answer because the word "All" is a valid name for one of the boys in the classroom. When they all went up to the blackboard and wrote their names, the name "All" was the only one that appeared on the blackboard, leading to the confusion. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the outcome.
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: On July 4, a girl traveled to the United States to party for three days before returning on July 4. How did she manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'July 7th is holiday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it logically explains how the girl was able to party in the United States for three days before returning on July 4. This answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible explanation for the girl's travel plans. None of the other answer choices offer a practical or realistic explanation for how the girl managed to party in the United States for three days before returning on the same date.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that the girls did not get wet because there was no rain. This explanation is simple, clear, and directly addresses the situation described in the question. The other answer choices introduce additional scenarios or assumptions that are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, "Because it was not raining" is the most logical and direct explanation for why the girls did not get wet while using the same umbrella.
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.

Question  13
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: [' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs" because it is a biological fact that roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described defies biological reality. This makes the answer the most logically and scientifically correct choice among the options provided.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how Brad survived the fall - he didn't actually jump outside the building, but rather inside, possibly into a small space or onto a lower level. This interpretation aligns with the fact that Brad was overcome with depression and simply wanted to escape the situation, without necessarily intending to harm himself.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: Andy is placed in a cell with no windows and a dirt floor. He can't reach the window because it's too high. A shovel is the sole object in the cell. He won't be able to find food or water, and he only has two days to flee or perish. Andy is unable to construct a tunnel since it will take him considerably longer than two days. How will Andy get out of the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy should use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the best answer because it provides a practical and feasible solution for Andy to reach the window and escape within the limited time frame of two days. Breaking the wall of the cell would be noisy and risky, while reflecting sunlight would not guarantee help in time. Creating a dirt pile allows Andy to utilize the resources he has in the cell to escape safely and effectively.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: In the midst of a plumbing shutdown, Jack was stuck on the tenth floor of an apartment building fixing a leaky pipe. The elevator was out of order due to the plumbing issue. How did he manage to get out of the building before the plumbing was fixed? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Jack get to the roof and escape.', 'Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator.\n', 'Jack needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator." This is the best answer because it directly addresses how Jack managed to exit the building despite the plumbing shutdown and the non-functional elevator. It highlights the simple and practical solution of using the stairs to leave the building, demonstrating logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Question  14
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional car that is neither a red or a blue.', 'Mrs.Smith has one car that is blue and red at the same time.', 'Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: Tom is a clean freak but he never dries his hair after a shower. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'He tries to stand upside down druing shower to avoid rain.', 'This man is bald.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald." because if Tom is a clean freak but never dries his hair after a shower, it can be inferred that he doesn't have any hair to dry. This is the most logical explanation for his behavior, as someone with hair would typically want to keep it clean and dry. Therefore, the fact that he never dries his hair suggests that he doesn't have any hair to dry, making the answer "This man is bald" the most plausible explanation.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery. In the operating room, a doctor came in and looked at the little boy and said I can't operate on him he is my son. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is the best answer because it challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions. The doctor being the mother of the son defies the stereotype that only men can be doctors, showcasing the importance of breaking down societal biases and expectations.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'He was on a motorcycle.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because a person on a motorcycle can take a bend with just two wheels on the pavement, as it is a common maneuver for motorcycles. The other answer choices do not provide a valid explanation for the situation described.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and feasible explanation for how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother.

Question: Why is the value of 1990 dollars higher than 1989 dollars ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because there is one more dollars.\n', 'Old money weight more than new money.', 'Old money is dirtier than new money.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because there is one more dollars" because it is a logical, simple and accurate explanation for why the value of 1990 dollars is higher than 1989 dollars. By stating that there is one extra dollar in 1990, it implies that the value has increased due to the additional dollar. The other options are not relevant or logical in explaining the increase in value.
Question: Walking along the seashore is a man. Without turning around, he is surprised to see his own footstep clearly. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is walking backward.', 'The reflection by the sea let him saw the footsetp.', 'The footstep will move all over around with water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is walking backward." This is the best answer because if the man is walking backward, the footstep he sees would be the one he just made, appearing to be in front of him without him turning around. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question and is the most logical explanation for the man's surprise at seeing his own footstep.

Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption." This is the best answer because turbulence can cause disruptions in electrical signals, including those transmitting music to Linda's headphones. No other answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the sudden interruption and subsequent resumption of the music.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.

Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.

Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is the best answer because it explains that the word "each" is a play on words, indicating that Each is the name of one of the men who took a pear. This clever wordplay allows for each man to take a pear and still leave nine hanging. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for how each man could take a pear and leave nine hanging.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.

Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: A man is walking along the sea beach. To his surprise, he can clearly see his own footstep without turning back. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is walking backward.', 'The footstep will move all over around with water.', 'The reflection by the sea let him saw the footsetp.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is walking backward." This is because when a person walks backward, they can see their own footsteps without having to turn back. This is the only logical explanation for how he can see his own footstep without turning around. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for the situation described.
Question: A woman is found dead in a field of snow. The only tracks are her own leading up to her. There are no signs of struggle, no other footprints, and no other evidence. Only an abandoned pack of balloons is found nearby. How did she die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She was in a hot air balloon which was losing altitude and crashed.', 'She was dead of a heart attack.', 'The womam killed herself with the toxic in ballon.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was in a hot air balloon which was losing altitude and crashed." This is the best answer because the abandoned pack of balloons found nearby suggests that the woman was using the balloons for some purpose. The lack of struggle or other evidence indicates that there was no foul play involved. Additionally, her own tracks leading up to her suggest that she was the only one present, making it likely that the hot air balloon was her sole means of transportation.
Question: There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert. How do they manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'They were in the middle of desert.', 'None of above.']

Question  16
Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.', 'It should be red as the whole house is in red.', 'The basement is uncolored as the basement is only used for storing stuffs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor." because the description specifically states that the house is one-story, meaning there are no additional floors below ground level. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that there is no basement in this type of house. The other answer choices make assumptions or provide irrelevant information, making them less appropriate answers.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: To go where he was going, the man had to cross the rivers. He was unable to utilize his inflatable raft because of a notice prohibiting boats and swimming on the bank. He finally succeeded in crossing the river. The only bridge on the river was broken. How didn't the man manage to do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'He jumped half-mile far to across the river.', 'He detoured for a long distance to avoid acrossing the river.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it explains how the man was able to cross the river without using a boat or the broken bridge. Crossing a frozen river would allow him to walk across safely, without the need for a raft or a detour. This also fits with the given information that the man was unable to use his inflatable raft due to the prohibition on boats and swimming, so the frozen river would have provided a convenient solution.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: It turns out that Sandy was being truthful when she said she had seen an forest devoid of leaves. How is it even doable?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sandy saw the forest on a map.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy snow.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sandy saw the forest on a map" because it provides a logical and feasible explanation for her claim of seeing a forest devoid of leaves. It is possible that the forest she saw on the map was in a different season or had experienced a natural phenomenon, such as a forest fire, which would explain the lack of leaves. This explanation aligns with Sandy being truthful about her observation.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.

Question  17
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the security and succeeded in the end.', 'At that time, he was just walking down the street. He stolen from others previously.', 'The people whom he had stolen is kind and rich.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the deceased could have a brother who is a beggar. Despite the wording of the question creating confusion, the simple explanation is that the beggar is actually a sister to the deceased, not a brother, resolving the apparent contradiction in the question.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how Brad survived the fall - he didn't actually jump outside the building, but rather inside, possibly into a small space or onto a lower level. This interpretation aligns with the fact that Brad was overcome with depression and simply wanted to escape the situation, without necessarily intending to harm himself.
Question: Despite being in June, David's birthday is never in the summer. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where the seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, June in Australia is actually in the winter season, not summer. This means that David's birthday, despite being in June, does not fall in the summer season.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.
Question: Despite being in December, David's birthday is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December falls in the summer instead of winter. Therefore, David's birthday is never in the winter because he lives in a location where December is a summer month.

Answer Choices: ['The glass is too heavy.', 'There is no wine in the glass.', 'Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no wine in the glass." This is the best answer because if there is no wine in the glass, then there is nothing to spill even if the glass is knocked over. This explanation accounts for the fact that not a single drop of wine leaked despite the glass being swung off the table. Therefore, this is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A girl finds a door, opens it, after sometime her body is found dead how is that possible since nobody shot her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the girl's body was found dead without being shot. Opening the door of an airplane in mid-flight would result in depressurization, leading to a rapid drop in altitude and causing her body to be found dead. This scenario aligns with the given information and provides a logical explanation for the girl's death.
Question: Every two weeks a woman sits down and writes two words on 60 sheets of paper. Why does she do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her hand writing.', 'The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks.', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks." This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific action of writing two words on 60 sheets of paper every two weeks - signing her employees' paychecks. It also accounts for the regular bi-weekly nature of the task and the specific quantity of paper. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a specific and logical explanation for the woman's behavior.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed.

Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.

Question  18
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The whether condition is pleasant.', 'The ground is close to a lake.', 'The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains how a stone buried in the ground could grow and produce fruit. It provides a logical and scientifically accurate explanation for the phenomenon described. The other answer choices are not relevant or plausible explanations for the situation.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.

Question  19
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: Four men were in a boat on the lake. The boat turns over, and all four men sink to the bottom of the lake, yet not a single man got wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', 'Because they were all married and not single.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and clear explanation for why none of the men got wet despite the boat turning over and sinking. The answer is a play on words, as it interprets "not a single man got wet" as meaning "not a single man who was unmarried got wet." This answer cleverly solves the riddle and makes the most sense in the context of the question.
Question: There are two bodies on the floor. They are surrounded by water and broken glass. How did they die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because the presence of water and broken glass suggests a fishbowl was involved, and the bodies being goldfish explains the two bodies on the floor. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario described, making them less likely explanations for the situation.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: Two men are using a ladder but both are face-to-face and can't pass each other. How's that physically possible ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two man are using the ladder alternatively.', 'The ladder is set horizontally and two people are hanging from it one going from left to right and the other one from right to left', 'With the help of optical illusions,both you and your friend can not pass each other.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ladder is set horizontally and two people are hanging from it one going from left to right and the other one from right to left". This is the best answer because it physically allows two people to be on the ladder and facing each other without being able to pass each other. This situation is physically possible as one person can be hanging from the ladder on one side and the other person hanging from the other side, preventing them from passing each other.
Question: Stranger: Is your dog biting? 
Farmer: No. 
The dog suddenly attacks the stranger on the leg. Nonetheless, the farmer was speaking the truth! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', "It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog." This is because the farmer never claimed that the dog attacking the stranger was his own. The question asked if the farmer's dog was biting, and his response was simply "No." The attack could have been carried out by another dog, making the farmer's statement technically truthful. Therefore, the best answer is that it was not the farmer's dog responsible for the attack.
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the security and succeeded in the end.', 'At that time, he was just walking down the street. He stolen from others previously.', 'The people whom he had stolen is kind and rich.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: There was a man who everybody called Batman he knew nothing about bats and thought they were gross. He still loved it when people called him Batman! How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." because it suggests that the man might have earned the nickname "Batman" due to his exceptional skills or achievements in baseball. This would explain why he loved being called Batman, despite his dislike for bats, as it would be associated with something positive and admirable. None of the other answer choices provide a clear and logical explanation for his enjoyment of the nickname.
Question: Joe and Sally were sitting in their family room one night. While Joe was watching T.V, his wife Sally was reading. All of a sudden the power went out and Joe decided to go to bed, but Sally kept on reading. With no use of artificial light, Sally kept on reading. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she pretended to reading the book.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Sally was able to continue reading without the use of artificial light after the power went out. Braille allows blind individuals to read by feeling raised dots on the page, so Sally was able to continue reading even in the dark.
Question: How many birth days does the average person have? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.', 'They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.', 'It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime." This is because a birth day refers to the specific day on which a person was born, and a person can only have one actual day of birth in their lifetime. While people may celebrate their birthdays annually, this does not change the fact that they were only born on one specific day. Therefore, the answer accurately reflects the concept of a birth day. None of the other options accurately address the concept of a birth day.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee." This is the best answer because it explains the situation in a logical and plausible way. It accounts for the man's actions of pushing the vehicle and his realization of being bankrupt upon arriving at the hotel. It also provides a scenario where the man's financial situation is directly relevant to his predicament, making it the most fitting explanation.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: Four cars come to a four way stop, all coming from a different direction. They can't decide who got there first, so they all go forward at the same time. They do not crash into each other, but all four cars go. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Their cars have different heights that can drive beyond each other.', 'They all made right-hand turns.', 'They decided to drive reversely with their rears forward first.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They all made right-hand turns." This is the best answer because if all four cars made right-hand turns, they would have been able to go forward without crashing into each other. Making right-hand turns would have allowed them to move in a clockwise direction around the intersection, avoiding a collision. Therefore, this is the most logical explanation for how all four cars were able to go forward at the same time without crashing.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry."

Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks." This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific action of writing two words on 60 sheets of paper every two weeks - signing her employees' paychecks. It also accounts for the regular bi-weekly nature of the task and the specific quantity of paper. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a specific and logical explanation for the woman's behavior.
Question: There are five apples in a basket. You distribute them among the five girls, giving each one an apple while leaving one apple in the basket. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket" because it is the most logical solution to ensure all five girls receive an apple. By giving the fifth girl her apple in the basket, all the apples are distributed and each girl receives one, while also leaving one apple in the basket. This resolves the initial problem without requiring any unlikely scenarios such as sharing or returning the apple.
Question: I dig out tiny caves and store gold and silver in them. I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold. They are the smallest you could imagine. Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am a miner.', 'I am a dentist.', 'I am a theif.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I am a dentist." This is because dentists dig out tiny caves (cavities) in teeth and store gold and silver (fillings) in them. They also build bridges of silver (dental bridges) and make crowns of gold (dental crowns). Many people are afraid to let dentists help them due to fear of dental procedures. None of the other answer choices fit all these clues as accurately as "I am a dentist."
Question: I dig out tiny caves and store gold and silver in them. I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold. They are the smallest you could imagine. Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am a miner.', 'I am a dentist.', 'I am a theif.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "I am a dentist." This is because dentists dig out tiny caves (cavities) in teeth and store gold and silver (fillings) in them. They also build bridges of silver (dental bridges) and make crowns of gold (dental crowns). Many people are afraid to let dentists help them due to fear of dental procedures. None of the other answer choices fit all these clues as accurately as "I am a dentist."

Question  20
Question: A cat was walking pass a security guard when the guard told him not to enter the area since it was restricted. However, the cat passed the security guard without any sense of obedience.Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The cat thought it won't bring danger", "Since cats can't understand humans' language", 'The cat thought it was hard to detect itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since cats can't understand humans' language". This is because cats do not have the ability to understand spoken language, so the cat would not have comprehended the security guard's warning. The cat's lack of obedience can be attributed to its inability to comprehend human communication, rather than a deliberate act of disobedience or calculation of potential danger.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: [' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs" because it is a biological fact that roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described defies biological reality. This makes the answer the most logically and scientifically correct choice among the options provided.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: Every day, a horse covers a particular distance. Strangely, two of its legs cover 30 miles daily while the other two cover about 31 miles. Given that the horse is typical, it would seem that two of its legs must be a mile ahead of the other two. However, this is obviously not the case. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The measurements are taken from different reference points.', 'The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs." This is the best answer because when the horse operates a mill and walks in a circular direction, the outer legs cover a greater distance due to the larger circumference of the circular path. Therefore, even though it may seem strange, the difference in distance covered by the legs is a result of the circular motion and not a discrepancy in the measurements.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is because the statement "I can't operate on him. He's my son" indicates that the doctor is the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions, highlighting the importance of diversity and representation in all fields, including medicine.
Question: Andy is placed in a cell with no windows and a dirt floor. He can't reach the window because it's too high. A shovel is the sole object in the cell. He won't be able to find food or water, and he only has two days to flee or perish. Andy is unable to construct a tunnel since it will take him considerably longer than two days. How will Andy get out of the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy should use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the best answer because it provides a practical and feasible solution for Andy to reach the window and escape within the limited time frame of two days. Breaking the wall of the cell would be noisy and risky, while reflecting sunlight would not guarantee help in time. Creating a dirt pile allows Andy to utilize the resources he has in the cell to escape safely and effectively.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.

Question  21
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.

Question  22
Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper." This explains why she frequently goes to high locations and jumps without getting hurt. As a sky jumper, she has the necessary training, equipment, and experience to safely perform these jumps. This behavior is not a sign of suicidal intent, but rather a recreational activity that she finds therapeutic.
Question: Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how Brad survived the fall - he didn't actually jump outside the building, but rather inside, possibly into a small space or onto a lower level. This interpretation aligns with the fact that Brad was overcome with depression and simply wanted to escape the situation, without necessarily intending to harm himself.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator." This is the best answer because it directly addresses how Jack managed to exit the building despite the plumbing shutdown and the non-functional elevator. It highlights the simple and practical solution of using the stairs to leave the building, demonstrating logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write.

How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.

Question  23
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A horse travels a certain distance each day. Strangely enough, two of its legs travel 30 miles each day and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles. It would seem that two of the horse's legs must be one mile ahead of the other two legs, but of course, this can't be true, since the horse is normal. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'The measurements are taken from different reference points.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs." This is the best answer because when a horse operates a mill, it moves in a circular motion, causing the outer legs to cover more distance than the inner legs. This explains why two legs travel 30 miles and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles each day. Therefore, this logically explains the seemingly impossible scenario.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: Why is Christmas Day so chilly? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December" because Christmas Day falls on December 25th, which is typically a winter month in the northern hemisphere. The colder temperatures are due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, causing less sunlight and shorter days during this time of year. Therefore, Christmas Day is generally chilly because it occurs during the winter season in December.
Question: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The coach of the team is the boy's mother.", "The boy's father gets a promotion.", 'The boy has two fathers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The coach of the team is the boy's mother." This is the best answer because it explains how the coach can refer to the boy as "my son" even though the man at the baseball game is the boy's father. It reveals that the coach is the boy's mother, allowing for both statements to be true.
Question: You are in a room with a ghost, but you are the only one in the room. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["You're the ghost.", 'The ghost is standing on your head.', 'The ghost is always standing behind you.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "You're the ghost." because it offers a logical explanation for the scenario. If I am the only one in the room with a ghost, it implies that I am the ghost because there are no other physical beings present. This answer aligns with the given situation and provides a reasonable explanation for the presence of the ghost.
Question: There was a guy who was really good at intercepting, however, each time he was caught intercepting, he wasn't being sent to jail. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was intercepting the ball in football and there was no warning for that.', 'All person intercepted are rich and kindess.', 'Intercepting is not a serious crime.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was intercepting the ball in football and there was no warning for that." This is the best answer because it specifies the context of the intercepting, indicating that it was related to a sports activity and not a criminal act. This explanation resolves the confusion about why the person wasn't being sent to jail for intercepting.
Question: Ten pears hanging high, Ten men come passing by, Each took a pear and left nine hanging there. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['EACH is the name of one of the men.', "Other men can't reach the pear.", "Other men didn't see the pear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is the best answer because it explains that the word "each" is a play on words, indicating that Each is the name of one of the men who took a pear. This clever wordplay allows for each man to take a pear and still leave nine hanging. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for how each man could take a pear and leave nine hanging.
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'The ground is close to a lake.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because certain fruits, like cherries, have a pit or stone inside that is actually the seed. When planted, the seed can sprout leaves and fruit, as it is a viable seed. The other answer choices do not provide a logical or feasible explanation for a stone sprouting leaves and fruit.

Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry" because if the well had no water in it, then the girl wouldn't have gotten wet despite falling 60 feet. It is physically impossible to fall into water and not get wet, so the only logical explanation is that the well is dry. This explanation accounts for the situation and is the most plausible among the given answer choices.
Question: How could a guy go outdoors in the torrential rain without getting a single hair on his head wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is bald.', '\nThe man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.', 'The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bald." This is because if a guy is bald, he does not have any hair on his head to get wet in the torrential rain. Therefore, he can go outdoors in the rain without getting a single hair on his head wet. This explanation logically and directly addresses the question by providing a specific reason for how the guy could stay dry in the rain.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.
Question: They are a couple of friends that are playing in water. Suddenly they get suffocated and die although they had their heads outside the water Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The friends were fish, playing in the water.', 'They laughed so hard and then they starved for oxygen.', 'The water was at an extremely low temperature that the firends got cold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The friends were fish, playing in the water." This is the best answer because fish are capable of breathing underwater using their gills, so they would not suffocate in the water. This explanation fits the given scenario of friends playing in the water and suddenly suffocating despite having their heads outside the water. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that the friends were actually fish.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: Why is the value of 1990 dollars higher than 1989 dollars ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because there is one more dollars.\n', 'Old money weight more than new money.', 'Old money is dirtier than new money.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because there is one more dollars" because it is a logical, simple and accurate explanation for why the value of 1990 dollars is higher than 1989 dollars. By stating that there is one extra dollar in 1990, it implies that the value has increased due to the additional dollar. The other options are not relevant or logical in explaining the increase in value.
Question: A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.

Answer Choices: ['The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', "The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without the need for weapons or suicide. It also fits the clue of the sealed envelope on the desk in front of him. The other options do not fit the evidence as well as the poison in the envelope.
Question: Here on Earth, a certain big animal prospers and lives happily. One day, a mystery disease that solely affects this unique species annihilates each and every one of these writers. They are all gone; there are none remaining everywhere on earth. They start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the animal is the Mule. This is because all Mules are born sterile, so you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse. This means that even if all the Mules were wiped out by a mystery disease, they could start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later through the crossbreeding of donkeys and horses. This unique reproductive characteristic of Mules allows for their reemergence despite being wiped out.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the possibility of a stone growing and producing fruit, by explaining that the "stone" was actually a seed. The explanation about the seed of a cherry being called a stone provides a logical and scientific explanation for the phenomenon, making it the most plausible and accurate option.
Question: A woman living in Rome legally gave birth to five children, but she has never been pregnant. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is a surrogate mother.', 'The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman is a surrogate mother." This is because a surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child on behalf of another person or couple. This means that she can legally give birth to children without ever being pregnant herself. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well and do not provide a logical explanation for the situation.

Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Without breaking any rules, a man managed to enter a ladies-only club. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was a security guard at the club.', 'He succeeded in getting away from the security.', 'The club wanted to make fun of the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was a security guard at the club." This is the best answer because being a security guard at the club gives him legitimate access to the premises without breaking any rules. As a security guard, he would have been authorized to enter the ladies-only club as part of his job responsibilities. Therefore, he did not need to sneak in or deceive anyone to gain entry.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.

He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.

 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sandy saw the forest on a map.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy snow.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sandy saw the forest on a map" because it provides a logical and feasible explanation for her claim of seeing a forest devoid of leaves. It is possible that the forest she saw on the map was in a different season or had experienced a natural phenomenon, such as a forest fire, which would explain the lack of leaves. This explanation aligns with Sandy being truthful about her observation.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.
Question: A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th." This is the best answer because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making the man's actual age 100 years old. Age is typically measured in years, so despite only celebrating 25 birthdays, his age would still be 100 years old based on the number of days he has lived.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed.

Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.

Answer Choices: ['The woman was a photographer.', 'People are enjoying themselves in the park.', 'The woman wanted to cause chaos.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer." This is because if the woman was a photographer, she may have been shooting with a camera, not a gun. Therefore, she could have been taking pictures of people in the National Park without causing harm. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the woman could shoot publicly at people in a National Park without anyone getting killed.

Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.

Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: There are 3 apples available for 2 fathers and 2 boys to consume. They each receive a single apple. How is it a mathematical possibility? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sons shared the same apple.', 'One father gave his apple to his son.', 'They are one son, one father and one grandfather.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one son, one father and one grandfather." This is the best answer because it allows for each person to receive an apple without anyone having to share or give up their own. It accounts for the 2 fathers, 2 boys, and the 3 apples by including a grandfather in the scenario, creating a mathematical possibility for each person to receive a single apple.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional car that is neither a red or a blue.', 'Mrs.Smith has one car that is blue and red at the same time.', 'Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the conditions given in the question - that all of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. This means she must have one cat and one dog, as stated in the answer choice. This is the only answer choice that fits all the conditions given in the question.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.

Question  26
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert. How do they manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'They were in the middle of desert.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions." This is the best answer because it resolves the apparent contradiction provided in the question. If the camels were facing each other the entire time, then they would indeed be facing in opposite directions without having to turn around or move their heads. This explanation provides a logical and simple resolution to the puzzle presented.
Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, the concept of stairs does not apply to a single-story house. This provides a clear and logical explanation for why the color of the stairs is not relevant to the scenario described.
Question: The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is the best answer because in a doubles tennis match, two players are on each team, and each team can win three sets, resulting in a total of five sets played. Therefore, it is conceivable for each man to win three sets in the five that were played because they were in a doubles match.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: A man is walking along the sea beach. To his surprise, he can clearly see his own footstep without turning back. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is walking backward.', 'The footstep will move all over around with water.', 'The reflection by the sea let him saw the footsetp.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is walking backward." This is because when a person walks backward, they can see their own footsteps without having to turn back. This is the only logical explanation for how he can see his own footstep without turning around. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for the situation described.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['John wanted to be a photographer.', 'John wants to be a video game designer  and his parent are addicted to vedio gams.', "The parents known John was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption.', 'All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The airplane required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption." This is the best answer because turbulence can cause disruptions in electrical signals, including those transmitting music to Linda's headphones. No other answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the sudden interruption and subsequent resumption of the music.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.

Best Answer: The best answer is "She was in a hot air balloon which was losing altitude and crashed." This is the best answer because the abandoned pack of balloons found nearby suggests that the woman was using the balloons for some purpose. The lack of struggle or other evidence indicates that there was no foul play involved. Additionally, her own tracks leading up to her suggest that she was the only one present, making it likely that the hot air balloon was her sole means of transportation.

Question  27
Question: Although they were born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were not born in the same year.', 'One student ran away from home at a young age.', 'One student had a bad academic grades and broken up with his parents.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were not born in the same year." This is because it is the most logical explanation for two students who are otherwise unrelated to share the same birthday. It is entirely conceivable that two unrelated students could be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, especially in a large school with many students. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for this situation is that the students were born on the same day of the same month but in different years.
Question: A man sails off on a cruise between Mexico and the USA. He does not stop at any ports and does not even come out of the cabin, yet he makes $300,000 from his trip. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a smuggler.", "He's a captain though he forgot to carry the passengers.", 'He got his tip from a rich passenger.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a smuggler." This is because the scenario describes a man who sails off on a cruise without stopping at any ports and without interacting with anyone, indicating that he is likely engaged in illegal activities such as smuggling contraband. The fact that he makes $300,000 from his trip further supports the idea that he is involved in a criminal enterprise. Therefore, "He's a smuggler" is the most plausible explanation for the man's actions and earnings.
Question: There were two bosses and two employees in a meeting room discussing different tasks. At the end of the meeting, there three tasks for all the people in that meeting. How is that possible Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss.", 'One boss gaves his fish to his employee.', 'Two employees shared the same task.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss." This explanation allows for two bosses and two employees in the meeting. One of the employees is also a boss, which can account for the three tasks assigned at the end of the meeting. This scenario logically explains how the situation is possible.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: There was a guy who was really good at intercepting, however, each time he was caught intercepting, he wasn't being sent to jail. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was intercepting the ball in football and there was no warning for that.', 'All person intercepted are rich and kindess.', 'Intercepting is not a serious crime.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was intercepting the ball in football and there was no warning for that." This is the best answer because it specifies the context of the intercepting, indicating that it was related to a sports activity and not a criminal act. This explanation resolves the confusion about why the person wasn't being sent to jail for intercepting.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Mark was in the kitchen cooking everyday and yet he wasn't getting paid. He had to buy all the ingredients and everything himself as well. why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was a chef and a dad at the same time. when he was home, nobody was paying him to cook', 'He wanted to research new creations.', 'He was so bad at cooking so the boss was unwilling to pay him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was a chef and a dad at the same time. when he was home, nobody was paying him to cook" because it provides a valid reason for why Mark was not getting paid for cooking. It explains that Mark's cooking was done at home as part of his role as a dad, not as part of his job as a chef where he would typically be paid for his cooking skills. This answer aligns with the scenario presented and provides a logical explanation for why Mark was not getting paid while cooking in the kitchen.

Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: In a remote village, a wise traveler decides to check out local dental implants. There are only two dentists in the village, each with a clinic. Glance at the first clinic and see that the dentist's own teeth are badly planted and his salon is poorly maintained. The second salon is tidy, the dentist's teeth are well planted and his attire is spotless. Why smart travelers choose dental implants in the first clinic? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentisit who had given his rival the better implants.", 'The traveler chose the first dentist because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the dentist was so busy.', 'The traveler went to the first dentist because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentist who had given his rival the better implants." This is the best answer because it suggests that the reason why the first dentist's teeth were poorly planted is because he had been busy giving the second dentist a better set of implants. It explains why the first dentist's salon was untidy and his own teeth poorly placed, leading the smart traveler to choose the first dentist for his own dental implants.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: Mark was a bad employee and his boss was annoyed by him. His boss wanted to do something to stop him from coming to the office. He picked up the phone and fixed the problem. Now, Mark can't come to the office and he's fired.  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore', "The boss used his phone to hit Mark's head heavily.", 'The boss called the police to tell them how worse the Mark was.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore." This is the best answer because it is a practical and logical solution to stop Mark from coming to the office, and it aligns with the boss's responsibility to manage the workplace. The other options are extreme and inappropriate actions that would not be a suitable response to a bad employee.
Question: A guy was just going about his business when his suit was ripped. Why did he pass away three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't afford to buy a new one.", "He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it provides a logical reason for his passing away three minutes later - the lack of a properly functioning suit in the vacuum of space would have led to rapid decompression and ultimately his demise. The other answer choices do not offer a reasonable explanation for his sudden passing.
Question: Without breaking any rules, a man managed to enter a ladies-only club. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was a security guard at the club.', 'He succeeded in getting away from the security.', 'The club wanted to make fun of the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was a security guard at the club." This is the best answer because being a security guard at the club gives him legitimate access to the premises without breaking any rules. As a security guard, he would have been authorized to enter the ladies-only club as part of his job responsibilities. Therefore, he did not need to sneak in or deceive anyone to gain entry.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Matthew is a deep-sea diver.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Matthew was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Matthew is a deep-sea diver" because his behavior of making plans to visit a deep spot and plunging into profound depths indicates that he has experience and comfort with deep-sea diving. His lack of injury or harm may be attributed to his training, experience, and knowledge of safe diving practices. This explanation aligns with his behavior and the lack of harm despite his risky behavior.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.

Question  28
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the seemingly impossible scenario described in the question. It explains that the "stone" was actually a seed, and that the fruit and leaves sprouting from it is a natural result of it being a seed and not an actual stone. This answer aligns with scientific knowledge and botanical terminology, making it the most plausible explanation.
Question: A man sails off on a cruise between Mexico and the USA. He does not stop at any ports and does not even come out of the cabin, yet he makes $300,000 from his trip. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a smuggler.", "He's a captain though he forgot to carry the passengers.", 'He got his tip from a rich passenger.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a smuggler." This is because the scenario describes a man who sails off on a cruise without stopping at any ports and without interacting with anyone, indicating that he is likely engaged in illegal activities such as smuggling contraband. The fact that he makes $300,000 from his trip further supports the idea that he is involved in a criminal enterprise. Therefore, "He's a smuggler" is the most plausible explanation for the man's actions and earnings.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because the statement is factually accurate and directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. Therefore, this answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.
Question: Sally lives in a place where six months of the year is mild summer and the temperature drops significantly the other six months. She owns a lake where there is a small island. She wants to build a house on the island and needs to get materials there. She doesn't have a boat, plane, or anything to transport them to the island. How does Sally solve this problem?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.', 'She drives a plane to load all the material she needs to the island.', 'She borrows necessary materials from her neighborhood. Her neighborhood is rich and friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Sally waits to take the materials over during the colder months when the lake freezes over, so she can walk over it. This solution is practical and cost-effective, as she does not need to invest in any transportation methods. Additionally, it allows her to transport the materials without relying on external help or resources. Overall, waiting for the lake to freeze over provides a simple and straightforward solution to Sally's transportation problem.
Question:  A hiker arrives near a lake. He sees a sign where it is written "No swimming allowed.", but the duck jumps into the water. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because ducks can't read.", "Because ducks won't polluted water.", 'Because ducks are tiny to be detected.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because ducks can't read." simply because ducks are not capable of understanding written signs or regulations. The other options do not provide a logical explanation as to why the duck would ignore the sign. Ducks being unable to read is the most straightforward and reasonable explanation for the duck's behavior.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.

This is the best answer because it provides a practical and realistic solution to her transportation issue without requiring her to obtain a boat or aircraft. Additionally, it takes into account the natural conditions of her environment, making it a feasible and cost-effective option.
Question: There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person already at the south side of the river.', 'They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." because it is the only plausible explanation given the constraints of the situation. Since the riddle states that only one person can fit on the boat, and there is no mention of the person being able to swim or another boat being available, the only logical conclusion is that there was already someone on the south side of the river. Therefore, this answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible solution to the riddle.
Question: A store has on sale a computer and word processor small enough to fit in your pocket. It can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write in all languages. A delete device will correct any error. No electricity is required to operate it. The price? Only a few cents! How can the store make a profit by selling it so cheap? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser." This is because the description matches that of a pencil, which can add (write), multiply (repeated writing), subtract (erase), and divide (separate words or numbers), and can write in all languages. The "delete device" refers to the eraser. The store can make a profit by selling it so cheap because the cost of producing a pencil is low, allowing for a high profit margin even with a low sale price.

Answer Choices: ['The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch.', 'The old man was granted exclusive access to the higher floors.', 'The woman thinks pressing the 17th button in the elevator brings good luck or wards off bad luck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and practical reason for why the woman asked the old man to press the 17th button - because he can reach it with the help of his crutch, while she cannot reach it herself. It also explains the situation in a way that makes sense given the man's physical limitations and the woman's need for assistance.

Answer Choices: ['You have to be a teacher.', 'You have to prepate for the whole year.', 'You have to ask teacher for the asnwer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "You have to be a teacher." This is because as a teacher, you would have access to the exam questions and answers before the students, giving you the advantage of knowing the answers sooner than everyone else in the room. This is the only option that directly addresses having an unfair advantage in the exam session.
Question: Assume you're in a room with no doors, windows, or anything else. How do you escape? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario provided is impossible and does not represent a real situation.

It also aligns with a plausible scenario in a grocery store setting.
Question: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am a dentist.', 'I am a theif.', 'I am a miner.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I am a dentist." This is because the clues in the description point to activities that a dentist would engage in, such as excavating little caves (referring to cavities in teeth), keeping gold and silver there (referring to fillings), creating gold crowns and silver bridges (referring to dental crowns and bridges), and the reluctance of people to accept assistance from a dentist. This all points to the profession of dentistry.
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food," because if the rope is not tied to anything, it would not restrict the horse's movement, allowing it to reach the food 15 meters away. This is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the horse was able to reach its food despite being tethered to a 5-meter long rope.
Question: Each and every day, a man gets up early to work out. He always spends a few hours running about his apartments. He surprises himself by discovering that, after a month of hard training, his left leg has acquired much more muscle than his right. How is that feasible since the man is normal and healthy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than inside leg.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'He may have a subtle bias or preference for using his right leg more than his left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than the inside leg." This is the best answer because when running in a circular clockwise direction, the outer leg (the left leg in this case) will cover a greater distance than the inner leg due to the arc of the circle. This discrepancy in distance covered by each leg could lead to the left leg gaining more muscle mass than the right. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why the left leg acquired more muscle after a month of hard training.
Question: Three people are stuck inside a dark cave. The first fears the complete darkness, the second fears bats, and the third fears getting lost. They don't have any flashlights, lanterns or any kind of light source, and their cell phones have no signal so they can't use them as a light source either. How do they get out of the cave? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.", 'They run over around the whole cave and find the way out.', 'They try to run away from the bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the problem of darkness without any light sources. If it's daytime outside the cave, there will be natural light, which allows them to navigate and find their way out without being hindered by their fears. This solution also does not involve any unnecessary or dangerous actions, making it the safest and most practical option.

Question  29
Question: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: [' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs" because it is a biological fact that roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described defies biological reality. This makes the answer the most logically and scientifically correct choice among the options provided.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is because the statement "I can't operate on him. He's my son" indicates that the doctor is the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions, highlighting the importance of diversity and representation in all fields, including medicine.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: A logical with some time to kill in a small town decided to get a haircut. The town had only two barber, each with his own shop. The logical glance into one shop and saw that it was extremely until. The barber needed a shave, his clothes were unkempt, and his hair was badly cut. The other shop was extremely neat. The barber was freshly shaved and spotlessly dressed, his hair neatly trimmed. Why did the logical return to the first shop for his haircut? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.

Question  30
Question: How many gold coins can a leprechaun throw in an empty pot? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Infinite number of gold coins.', 'One. After that, it no longer empty.', 'It based on the size of the pot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One. After that, it no longer empty." because once a leprechaun throws a single gold coin into an empty pot, it is no longer empty. This answer directly addresses the specific condition of the pot being empty and the action of throwing a gold coin into it, making it the most accurate choice among the provided options. It is not possible for an infinite number of coins to be thrown into an empty pot, and the number of coins thrown is not dependent on the size of the pot. Therefore, the best answer is the one that reflects the immediate change in the pot's status after the first coin is thrown.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: In 1898, a guy was born. He is still living at the age of 33.  How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old.', 'he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.', 'His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was born in room 1898 in the hospital." This answer gives a logical explanation for how someone could be born in 1898 and still be living at the age of 33. It suggests that the person was born in a specific room named "1898" in a hospital, rather than being born in the year 1898. This cleverly resolves the apparent contradiction and provides a plausible explanation for the person's age.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It is a spaceship.', 'The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses.', 'There are reflection on the island.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses" because if the ship is positioned equidistant from both lighthouses, the light from both of them will reach the ship at the same time. This is possible because the light from one lighthouse will travel directly to the ship, and the light from the other lighthouse will also reach the ship without interference. This scenario allows both lighthouses to illuminate the same ship at the same time.
Question: Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It is a spaceship.', 'The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses.', 'There are reflection on the island.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses" because if the ship is positioned equidistant from both lighthouses, the light from both of them will reach the ship at the same time. This is possible because the light from one lighthouse will travel directly to the ship, and the light from the other lighthouse will also reach the ship without interference. This scenario allows both lighthouses to illuminate the same ship at the same time.

Question  31
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: A boy had just gotten out of the shower and was getting ready for his prom, shaved and with cologne, and there would be an after-party. And his mom and dad said to be home for the next sunrise and he was home for the next sunrise but with a full-grown beard. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He went crazy with friends in that unnormal party.', 'His beard grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months." This is the best answer because in some parts of Alaska, the sun does not set for several months during the summer due to the phenomenon of the midnight sun. Therefore, the boy being home for the next sunrise with a full-grown beard would make sense if he lived in a place where sunrises only occur every six months. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the boy's sudden beard growth.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: How can you physically stand behind your friend as he physically stands behind you? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By standing stand upside down.', 'With the help of optical illusions.', 'By standing back to back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "By standing back to back." This is because standing back to back allows you to physically stand behind your friend as he also physically stands behind you. It positions each person in a way that they are behind the other, creating a physical arrangement where both individuals are able to stand behind each other. This is the only practical and plausible way to achieve the desired positioning.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: Nolan is in front of a store. She is unable to read the signs, but she is aware that she must enter in order to make a purchase. Where in the store is she? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bakery.', 'Fruit store.', 'Eye glasses store.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the eye glasses store. Since Nolan is unable to read the signs but knows she needs to enter to make a purchase, it is likely that she needs help with her vision. This makes it highly probable that she is in front of an eye glasses store.
Question: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Cafe.', 'Bakery.', 'Clock store.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Clock store" because Emily needs to find out the time and the most logical place to do that would be a store that sells clocks. The other options (cafe and bakery) do not provide a solution for finding out the time. Therefore, the clock store is the best choice for Emily to find out what time it is.
Question: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Cafe.', 'Bakery.', 'Clock store.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Clock store" because Emily needs to find out the time and the most logical place to do that would be a store that sells clocks. The other options (cafe and bakery) do not provide a solution for finding out the time. Therefore, the clock store is the best choice for Emily to find out what time it is.

Question  32
Question: Imagine you are in a room, with no doors, windows, or anything. How do you get out? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario presented is not a real-life situation - it's just a thought experiment. There is no actual room to escape from, so the only solution is to stop imagining the scenario. This answer acknowledges the hypothetical nature of the question and provides a clear and logical way to "escape" from the thought experiment.
Question: What question can someone ask all day long, always get completely different answers, and yet all the answers could be correct? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['What time is it?', "What's the square root of 16?", 'What is the result of 5317 by 9321.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "What time is it?" because the answer will change throughout the day, depending on the time. Different people in different locations will provide different answers, and all of them could be correct. Additionally, time is a constantly changing and subjective measurement, making it the perfect question to receive completely different yet correct answers all day long.
Question: There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person already at the south side of the river.', 'They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." because it is the only plausible explanation given the constraints of the situation. Since the riddle states that only one person can fit on the boat, and there is no mention of the person being able to swim or another boat being available, the only logical conclusion is that there was already someone on the south side of the river. Therefore, this answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible solution to the riddle.
Question: How can you enter a exam session and have the answers sooner than everybody else in the room? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['You have to be a teacher.', 'You have to prepate for the whole year.', 'You have to ask teacher for the asnwer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "You have to be a teacher." This is because as a teacher, you would have access to the exam questions and answers before the students, giving you the advantage of knowing the answers sooner than everyone else in the room. This is the only option that directly addresses having an unfair advantage in the exam session.
Question: They were eight students, taking an exam with nobody else inside the room. when the time was up, they were only 7 taken tests. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the students was a examiner.', 'Two students had the same answer, so they just handed in one paper.', 'One student handed in a blank paper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the students was an examiner." This is the best answer because if one of the students was an examiner, then there were actually only 7 students taking the exam. The examiner would not need to hand in a test paper, which explains why there were only 7 tests turned in.
Question: How could a guy go outdoors in the torrential rain without getting a single hair on his head wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is bald.', '\nThe man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.', 'The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bald." This is because if a guy is bald, he does not have any hair on his head to get wet in the torrential rain. Therefore, he can go outdoors in the rain without getting a single hair on his head wet. This explanation logically and directly addresses the question by providing a specific reason for how the guy could stay dry in the rain.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food," because if the rope is not tied to anything, it would not restrict the horse's movement, allowing it to reach the food 15 meters away. This is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the horse was able to reach its food despite being tethered to a 5-meter long rope.
Question: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because roosters don't lay eggs.", 'His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.', 'Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the issue of not getting any eggs from the roosters. It explains that the farmer did not receive any eggs because roosters are not capable of laying eggs, as only hens can lay eggs. Therefore, it provides a logical and straightforward explanation for the farmer's lack of eggs despite providing food for the roosters.
Question: A girl fell into a 60-foot well after slipping, but she was unwet. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry" because if the well had no water in it, then the girl wouldn't have gotten wet despite falling 60 feet. It is physically impossible to fall into water and not get wet, so the only logical explanation is that the well is dry. This explanation accounts for the situation and is the most plausible among the given answer choices.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because the statement is factually accurate and directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. Therefore, this answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.
Question: A girl slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry." This is the best answer because if the well did not have any water in it, then the girl would not have gotten wet when she fell in. This explanation makes logical sense and is the most reasonable explanation for how the girl did not get wet after falling into the well. Therefore, "The well is dry" is the best answer.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that penguins and their eggs are not available in the Arctic, therefore not part of the traditional or cultural diet of the natives. This explanation aligns with the question's emphasis on the natives of the Arctic, ensuring that it specifically addresses why they would not eat a penguin's egg.
Question: A man was staring out a sixth-floor window when he decided to jump. He did not perish or get any injuries. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt.', 'He used the collision between his body and walls to slow down.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it." because it provides a logical explanation for why the man did not perish or get injured after jumping from the sixth floor. If he was outside the window to wash it, then he would have been attached to a safety harness or rope, which would have prevented him from falling to the ground. This explanation is the most plausible and realistic, given the circumstances described.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: Some months have eight letters in their name, whereas others have five. How many have three?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They all do.', 'June.', 'August.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They all do" because there are 12 months in a year, and all of them have three letters in their name (January, May, and March). So, all months have three letters in their name. Therefore, "They all do" is the correct answer.
Question: A man was born in 1898. He is still alive now at the age 33  How is this possible ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.', 'He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old.', 'His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was born in room 1898 in the hospital" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation. The statement "He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old" does not explain how he could still be alive at the age of 33, and "His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years" does not make sense as it would only make him 8 years old in leap years. Therefore, the explanation that he was born in room 1898 in the hospital is the most likely reason for his longevity.
Question: How was it possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is because the question is asking how it was possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday. The explanation is that the cowboy's horse is named Wednesday, so when he arrives in town on Friday, stays for Saturday and Sunday, and leaves on Wednesday, it appears as though he stayed for two days, when in reality he stayed for five days.
Question: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.", 'There was a one-week long holidays.', 'He fiies straightly for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday" because it is a clever and humorous play on words. It is physically impossible to take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday without manipulating time or having a plane with a unique name like "Tuesday." This answer provides a creative and lighthearted explanation for the impossible scenario.
Question: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.", 'There was a one-week long holidays.', 'He fiies straightly for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "He flies straight for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left." This is the best answer because it suggests that the pilot crossed the International Date Line while flying from Los Angeles to Tokyo. By doing so, the pilot would essentially "gain" a day, landing in Tokyo on Tuesday despite flying for 48 hours. This explanation aligns with the realities of international travel and time zone differences, making it the most logical solution to the scenario.

Question  33
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it directly addresses the question by explaining how George escaped the building during the power outage. Since he disabled the electric hoist on his platform, he would not have been able to use it to descend from the eighth floor. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a feasible alternative for George to escape from the building in this situation.
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, the concept of stairs does not apply to a single-story house. This provides a clear and logical explanation for why the color of the stairs is not relevant to the scenario described.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Single-story houses are designed without multiple floors, so it is not common for them to have stairs. This answer makes the most sense in the context of the given scenario and is the most accurate choice.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.', 'The basement is uncolored as the basement is only used for storing stuffs.', 'It should be red as the whole house is in red.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor." This is the best answer because a one-story house does not typically have a basement. Since the house is built on a single floor, there is no space underneath for a basement. Therefore, the concept of the color of the basement does not apply to this type of house.
Question: A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.', 'It should be red as the whole house is in red.', 'The basement is uncolored as the basement is only used for storing stuffs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor." because the description specifically states that the house is one-story, meaning there are no additional floors below ground level. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that there is no basement in this type of house. The other answer choices make assumptions or provide irrelevant information, making them less appropriate answers.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, he could use the sound of the bullet hitting the hat to determine the direction in which he needed to aim and shoot. This allowed him to accurately shoot the bullet into the hat while blindfolded and without the use of his vision. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for how the shooter could achieve this feat.

Question  34
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional car that is neither a red or a blue.', 'Mrs.Smith has one car that is blue and red at the same time.', 'Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: How many birth days do most people have on average? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.', 'It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.', 'They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime." This is the best answer because biologically, a person is born on a specific day and that day is considered their birth day. While people may celebrate their birthdays annually, the actual birth day remains the same. Therefore, on average, most people only have one birth day in their lifetime.
Question: A simple peasant bought a number of camels and is taking them to his farm. As he rides contentedly along he counts them - he counts 29. He was sure he had bought 30 camel, so in alarm he jumps off his camel and counts the camels again. To his delight there are 30. Half an hour later, he counts his camels and once more there are just 29. Confused, he climbs off his camel and counts again. Once more there are 30. Can you explain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it" because when the peasant is riding the camel, he is only able to count the 29 camels walking alongside him. However, when he dismounts and counts them again, he includes the camel he was previously riding, totaling 30. When he gets back on the camel, he forgets to count it, leading to the discrepancy in the count once more. This explanation accounts for the fluctuation in the number of camels the peasant counts.
Question: Tom is a clean freak but he never dries his hair after a shower. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'He tries to stand upside down druing shower to avoid rain.', 'This man is bald.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald." because if Tom is a clean freak but never dries his hair after a shower, it can be inferred that he doesn't have any hair to dry. This is the most logical explanation for his behavior, as someone with hair would typically want to keep it clean and dry. Therefore, the fact that he never dries his hair suggests that he doesn't have any hair to dry, making the answer "This man is bald" the most plausible explanation.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: A man and his dog are both standing on opposite sides of a river. The guy summons his dog, who quickly crosses the river without getting wet. There were no bridges or boats. What was the dog's secret? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'The river was frozen.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is because if the river was frozen, the dog could easily walk across the ice without getting wet. This explanation fits the scenario where the dog quickly crosses the river without using any bridges or boats.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket." This is the best answer because it follows the given conditions - each girl gets an apple, and one apple remains in the basket. This solution does not involve sharing or returning the apple, ensuring that each girl gets an apple and one remains in the basket.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: A town that has been painted black has a black dog standing in the midst of an intersection. Due to a storm-related power outage, none of the street lights are functioning. When a car with two broken headlights approaches the dog, it turns away in time to miss him. How was the dog able to be seen by the driver in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'It was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because even though the town has been painted black and the street lights are not functioning due to a power outage, the scenario mentions nothing about it being night time. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is still daylight, allowing the driver to see the dog in time to avoid hitting it.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: A lady sits down every two weeks and writes two words on 60 pieces of paper. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her hand writing.', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is: The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks. This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific and recurrent action of writing two words on 60 pieces of paper every two weeks. It also provides a practical reason for why she would do this, as it is a routine task related to paying her employees. The other answer choices do not provide a specific and practical reason for the woman's behavior.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery. In the operating room, a doctor came in and looked at the little boy and said I can't operate on him he is my son. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is the best answer because it challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions. The doctor being the mother of the son defies the stereotype that only men can be doctors, showcasing the importance of breaking down societal biases and expectations.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the second door with the lions. The lions that haven't eaten in 5 years would have likely died of starvation. This would make it the safest option among the three doors, as the other options (fire and lava or a 1,000-foot drop into alligators) would likely result in certain death.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the best answer choice.

Question  35
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A man was swimming in a sea, when he had a small injury and he lost only a small amount of blood, a minute later, he died in a painful way Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never get hurt before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'When he started bleeding, a shark noticed and ate him.', "The wound won't heal in the sea. He was so afraid of dying and scared himself.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he started bleeding, a shark noticed and ate him." This is the best answer because a small injury and loss of blood in the sea would attract sharks, especially if the injured person is floundering and in distress. The shark's attack would have caused a painful death, and this explanation is the most plausible given the circumstances.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: There were twenty boys with different names in the classroom, All went up to the blackboard and wrote names on the board, however, there was only one name on the board, how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other boys don't have names.", 'All is the name of one of the boys.', "Other boys don't know how to write.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All is the name of one of the boys." This is the best answer because the word "All" is a valid name for one of the boys in the classroom. When they all went up to the blackboard and wrote their names, the name "All" was the only one that appeared on the blackboard, leading to the confusion. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the outcome.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.

Question  36
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'He was on a motorcycle.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because a person on a motorcycle can take a bend with just two wheels on the pavement, as it is a common maneuver for motorcycles. The other answer choices do not provide a valid explanation for the situation described.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is carrying three pieces of gold each piece weighing one kilogram. While taking a walk he comes to a bridge that has a sign posted saying the bridge could hold only a maximum of 80 kilograms. John weighs 78 kilograms and the gold weighs three kilograms. Johnny reads the sign and still safely crossed the bridge with all the gold. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he juggled the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because by juggling the gold, Johnny was able to have only one or two pieces on the bridge at any given time, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeded the limit of 80 kilograms. Therefore, he was able to safely cross the bridge with all the gold.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine would have the capability to intentionally sink a ship without the need for a storm or mechanical issue. This explanation is also supported by the fact that the ship sank in front of onlookers and that there were no unusual circumstances such as too many fish or too many spectators in the harbor.

Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.

Question  37
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.

Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.

Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone."

The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds.

Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.

Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.

Question  39
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['May 6th is holiday.', 'He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.', 'The boy drank a lot and slept at festival for 5 days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: How can you leave a room with two legs and return with six legs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bring another man back with you.', 'Bring a chair back with you.', "You're walking back upside down.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bring a chair back with you." This is because if you leave a room with two legs (your own) and return with six legs, it implies that you have brought something with four legs (such as a chair) back with you. This answer aligns with the logic of the question and provides a feasible explanation for the scenario.
Question: There are five apples in a basket. You distribute them among the five girls, giving each one an apple while leaving one apple in the basket. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket" because it is the most logical solution to ensure all five girls receive an apple. By giving the fifth girl her apple in the basket, all the apples are distributed and each girl receives one, while also leaving one apple in the basket. This resolves the initial problem without requiring any unlikely scenarios such as sharing or returning the apple.
Question: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the deceased could have a brother who is a beggar. Despite the wording of the question creating confusion, the simple explanation is that the beggar is actually a sister to the deceased, not a brother, resolving the apparent contradiction in the question.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: In an ancient village, 30 warriors are equipped with 30 spears. They encountered a stash of 30 golden coins. Each took one, and yet there were still 29 left. How could this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some warriors sold their spears to exchange new golden coins.', "Each is the name of one of the warriors, and he's the only one who took a coin.", 'Several warriors refused to take golden coins as the action was implite.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the warriors, and he's the only one who took a coin." This is because the riddle is referring to the individual names of the warriors, with "Each" being one of the specific warriors who took a coin. Therefore, when it says "and yet there were still 29 left," it is referring to the remaining warriors who did not take a coin. This explanation fits the riddle's scenario and provides a logical solution.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother." This is because with six daughters and one brother, there are a total of 7 siblings, which fits within the family of 9 people. By having each daughter share the same brother, it explains how there can be 6 daughters and one brother without exceeding the total number of family members.
Question: Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother." This answer is the best because it provides a logical and feasible explanation for the situation. By stating that each daughter shares the same brother, it accounts for the 6 daughters and one brother without exceeding the total of 9 people in the family. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the question and fits the scenario described.

Question  40
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: When the radio abruptly stops playing, Fred is still listening to it. Fred is alone, and no one plays with the radio. After a brief pause, the radio starts up again. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel." This is because when a car enters a tunnel, the radio signal can be disrupted or lost, causing the radio to abruptly stop playing and then start up again once the car exits the tunnel. This scenario explains why Fred is still listening to the radio and why it starts up again after a brief pause. None of the other answer choices provide a reasonable explanation for the radio's behavior.
Question: A man was in a restaurant, and asked another person how's the food and the guy recommended some dishes and said they're absolutely astonishing. The food was really bad though. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man lost his sense of taste during the process.', "The man ate dishes up quickly and couldn't taste them.", 'The person that was asked was the owner of the restaurant.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The person that was asked was the owner of the restaurant." This is because the owner of the restaurant may have a bias towards promoting their own dishes, even if they are not actually good. The man, trusting the recommendation from the owner, may have believed that the food was better than it actually was. Therefore, this scenario explains why the man thought the food was astonishing despite it being bad.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: David's birthday is in December, but it is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia" because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December is actually in the summer season. Therefore, even though David's birthday is in December, it is not in the winter because of the geographic location of Australia.
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A man took several shots heavily and even fell down from the hit, but he still survived. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man has a strong ability to heal himself.', 'The man is strong enough.', 'They were whiskey shots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were whiskey shots." because the phrase "took several shots heavily" typically refers to consuming alcoholic beverages, not getting physically shot. Therefore, the man survived because he consumed a large amount of whiskey and not because of any extraordinary physical ability.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he's bankrupt. What happened? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee" because it includes the element of being bankrupt after reaching the hotel, which aligns with the initial scenario. The other options do not fully account for the man being bankrupt upon arrival at the hotel. This answer also introduces a creative and unexpected twist, making it the most interesting and fitting choice.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'He was on a motorcycle.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because a person on a motorcycle can take a bend with just two wheels on the pavement, as it is a common maneuver for motorcycles. The other answer choices do not provide a valid explanation for the situation described.
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: A man sets out to plant a flower at sunrise and his friend asks him to return by the next moonrise. But when he returns, the flower he planted has already wither and fall. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His friends waters the flower very carefully.', 'His flower grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months." This is the best answer because in Alaska, the phenomenon of the polar day and night can cause the sun to be visible for up to six months, followed by a six-month period of darkness. Therefore, the flower would wither and fall before the next moonrise due to the extended period of sunlight or darkness.
Question: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This answer makes the most sense because it explains how the woman could have "shot" her husband, held him underwater (in a darkroom's chemical bath), and then "hung" him (to dry as a photograph) without actually harming him. This explanation aligns with the actions described in the question and does not involve any illegal or impossible scenarios.
Question: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could have "shot" her husband, held him underwater (in a darkroom's chemical bath), and then "hung" him (to dry as a photograph) without actually harming him. This explanation aligns with the actions described in the question and does not involve any illegal or impossible scenarios.

Question  41
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is carrying three pieces of gold each piece weighing one kilogram. While taking a walk he comes to a bridge that has a sign posted saying the bridge could hold only a maximum of 80 kilograms. John weighs 78 kilograms and the gold weighs three kilograms. Johnny reads the sign and still safely crossed the bridge with all the gold. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he juggled the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because by juggling the gold, Johnny was able to have only one or two pieces on the bridge at any given time, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeded the limit of 80 kilograms. Therefore, he was able to safely cross the bridge with all the gold.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.

Question  42
Question: A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th." This is the best answer because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making the man's actual age 100 years old. Age is typically measured in years, so despite only celebrating 25 birthdays, his age would still be 100 years old based on the number of days he has lived.
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: A horse travels a certain distance each day. Strangely enough, two of its legs travel 30 miles each day and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles. It would seem that two of the horse's legs must be one mile ahead of the other two legs, but of course, this can't be true, since the horse is normal. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'The measurements are taken from different reference points.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs." This is the best answer because when a horse operates a mill, it moves in a circular motion, causing the outer legs to cover more distance than the inner legs. This explains why two legs travel 30 miles and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles each day. Therefore, this logically explains the seemingly impossible scenario.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.

Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it directly addresses the question by explaining how George escaped the building during the power outage. Since he disabled the electric hoist on his platform, he would not have been able to use it to descend from the eighth floor. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a feasible alternative for George to escape from the building in this situation.

There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.

Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.

Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others.

Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.

Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.

Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']

Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.

The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current.

This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.

Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.

Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.

Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is the best answer because in a doubles tennis match, two players are on each team, and each team can win three sets, resulting in a total of five sets played. Therefore, it is conceivable for each man to win three sets in the five that were played because they were in a doubles match.
Question: A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.
How did he die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', "The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without the need for weapons or suicide. It also fits the clue of the sealed envelope on the desk in front of him. The other options do not fit the evidence as well as the poison in the envelope.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: A woman living in Rome legally gave birth to five children, but she has never been pregnant. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is a surrogate mother.', 'The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman is a surrogate mother." This is because a surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child on behalf of another person or couple. This means that she can legally give birth to children without ever being pregnant herself. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well and do not provide a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: A man is walking along the sea beach. To his surprise, he can clearly see his own footstep without turning back. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is walking backward.', 'The footstep will move all over around with water.', 'The reflection by the sea let him saw the footsetp.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is walking backward." This is because when a person walks backward, they can see their own footsteps without having to turn back. This is the only logical explanation for how he can see his own footstep without turning around. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for the situation described.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['John wanted to be a photographer.', 'John wants to be a video game designer  and his parent are addicted to vedio gams.', "The parents known John was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption.', 'All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The airplane required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption." This is the best answer because turbulence can cause disruptions in electrical signals, including those transmitting music to Linda's headphones. No other answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the sudden interruption and subsequent resumption of the music.
Question: Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: Ten pears hanging high, Ten men come passing by, Each took a pear and left nine hanging there. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['EACH is the name of one of the men.', "Other men can't reach the pear.", "Other men didn't see the pear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is the best answer because it explains that the word "each" is a play on words, indicating that Each is the name of one of the men who took a pear. This clever wordplay allows for each man to take a pear and still leave nine hanging. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for how each man could take a pear and leave nine hanging.
Question: They are a couple of friends that are playing in water. Suddenly they get suffocated and die although they had their heads outside the water Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The friends were fish, playing in the water.', 'They laughed so hard and then they starved for oxygen.', 'The water was at an extremely low temperature that the firends got cold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The friends were fish, playing in the water." This is the best answer because fish are capable of breathing underwater using their gills, so they would not suffocate in the water. This explanation fits the given scenario of friends playing in the water and suddenly suffocating despite having their heads outside the water. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that the friends were actually fish.
Question: Here on Earth, a certain big animal prospers and lives happily. One day, a mystery disease that solely affects this unique species annihilates each and every one of these writers. They are all gone; there are none remaining everywhere on earth. They start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the animal is the Mule. This is because all Mules are born sterile, so you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse. This means that even if all the Mules were wiped out by a mystery disease, they could start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later through the crossbreeding of donkeys and horses. This unique reproductive characteristic of Mules allows for their reemergence despite being wiped out.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.
Question: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The coach of the team is the boy's mother.", "The boy's father gets a promotion.", 'The boy has two fathers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The coach of the team is the boy's mother." This is the best answer because it explains how the coach can refer to the boy as "my son" even though the man at the baseball game is the boy's father. It reveals that the coach is the boy's mother, allowing for both statements to be true.
Question: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The coach of the team is the boy's mother.", "The boy's father gets a promotion.", 'The boy has two fathers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The coach of the team is the boy's mother." This is the best answer because it explains how the coach can refer to the boy as "my son" even though the man at the baseball game is the boy's father. It reveals that the coach is the boy's mother, allowing for both statements to be true.

Question  47
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: When a woman is about to leave for an overseas conference, she realizes she left her presentation slides at her workplace. "Miss, don't board the ship," the security guard pleads as he stops her while she dashes into the office to fetch them. "I had a dream last night that the ship would sink and everyone aboard would drown." Heeding his warning, she decides not to go. As predicted, the ship sinks, with no survivors. The next day, the woman rewards the guard with a $5,000 bonus for saving her life before letting him go. Why did she dismiss the guard who saved her life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman thought five thousands dollars is too much for a reward.', 'The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty.', 'The watchman was fired for not warning the woman in advance.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty." This is because the woman dismissed the guard after rewarding him, indicating that there was a negative consequence for him despite saving her life. Additionally, the guard's warning was proven accurate, so the dismissal must have stemmed from another reason, such as neglecting his duty by sleeping on the job.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: A cat was walking pass a security guard when the guard told him not to enter the area since it was restricted. However, the cat passed the security guard without any sense of obedience.Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The cat thought it won't bring danger", "Since cats can't understand humans' language", 'The cat thought it was hard to detect itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since cats can't understand humans' language". This is because cats do not have the ability to understand spoken language, so the cat would not have comprehended the security guard's warning. The cat's lack of obedience can be attributed to its inability to comprehend human communication, rather than a deliberate act of disobedience or calculation of potential danger.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: One morning a man is leaving on a business trip and finds he left some paperwork at his office. He runs into his office to get it and the night watchman stops him and says, "Sir, don't get on the plane. I had a dream last night that the plane would crash and everyone would die!" The man takes his word and cancels his trip. Sure enough, the plane crashes and everyone dies. The next morning the man gives the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life and then fires him. Why did he fire the watchman that saved his life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The watchman was fired for not warning the man in advance.', 'The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.', 'The man thought one thousand dollars is too much for a reward.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job" because the man gave the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life, indicating that he was grateful for the warning. However, the watchman's primary job was to keep watch and ensure the security of the building, not to be asleep on the job. The man likely fired the watchman for negligence in carrying out his duties, rather than for the warning about the plane crash.
Question: A logical with some time to kill in a small town decided to get a haircut. The town had only two barber, each with his own shop. The logical glance into one shop and saw that it was extremely until. The barber needed a shave, his clothes were unkempt, and his hair was badly cut. The other shop was extremely neat. The barber was freshly shaved and spotlessly dressed, his hair neatly trimmed. Why did the logical return to the first shop for his haircut? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: Two cars were involved in an accident in the center of town. The man who was driving a little green car, had overtaken a big black car. The driver had misjudged the distance between him and the on-coming traffic and had to serve back in, causing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the occupants of the cars were examined everyone in the green car was okay, but in the black car was one dead man. However, the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter, why was this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral." This is the best answer because there was already a dead man in the black car, so the driver of the green car could not be charged with manslaughter for the death resulting from the accident. The presence of the deceased person in the black car explains why the driver of the green car was not charged.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is because the statement "I can't operate on him. He's my son" indicates that the doctor is the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions, highlighting the importance of diversity and representation in all fields, including medicine.

Question  48
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself. This scenario would allow her to be legally wed to three men without being divorced, enrolled, or separated from any of them.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Two men had to go to the south side of the river, the river is pretty wide and rapid. There is one boat, but only one person fits on it. Lucky they both got to the south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'One person already at the south side of the river.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." This is the best answer because it suggests that one of the men was already on the south side of the river, so he didn't need to cross it. Therefore, the other man used the boat to go across and then both of them were on the south side. This is the only logical explanation for both men ending up on the south side with only one boat.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the conditions given in the question - that all of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. This means she must have one cat and one dog, as stated in the answer choice. This is the only answer choice that fits all the conditions given in the question.
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: A person was outside when it started snowing heavily. Even though he was directly exposed to the snowfall without any protection, not a single snowflake landed on his hair. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'The man succeeded in avoiding all snow flake.', 'He is bold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bold." This is because the scenario described in the question is likely a play on the phrase "not a hair out of place," meaning the person managed to avoid being affected by the heavy snowfall despite being directly exposed to it. It is a clever twist on the traditional idea of not a single hair being out of place, and the answer "He is bold" plays on this clever wordplay.
Question: There were a group of people including artists, doctors, and nurses all in a flight. The flight crashed before getting to the destination but no man was injured nor died. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The flight crashed in a remote and uninhabited area with no witnesses.', 'All the passengers were skilled in crash survival.', 'All the people on the flight were female.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All the people on the flight were female." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and reasonable explanation for why no one was injured or died in the crash. If all the people on the flight were female, then it would not be possible for "no man" to be injured or die in the crash. Therefore, this answer effectively solves the riddle provided.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Two men are found dead in their house, however there is no sign of one of them killing the other one, neither the sign of any other intruders. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were frightened to death by the sound of thunder and lightning.', "They're twins, and their genes let them die together.", 'They both comitted suiside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They both committed suicide." This is because it explains the possibility of two men found dead in their house without signs of one killing the other or any other intruder. Suicide by both individuals would account for their deaths without any external involvement. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical solution to the mystery.
Question: Tom received an invitation to a holiday party. He was shocked to discover that no single person was at the party. The party is still filled with singing, though. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The singing is came from the food on party.', 'The music is not good as normal people.', 'All people at the party except Tom is married.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All people at the party except Tom is married." This is the best answer because it explains how there are no single people at the party, but there is still singing. The implication is that the married couples are the ones singing together, hence the absence of single individuals. This answer provides a logical explanation for the situation described in the question.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother" because this scenario is possible if the sisters all have the same brother, meaning there is only one brother in the family. This would make a total of seven children (6 daughters and 1 brother), along with the parents, totaling nine family members. This explanation fits within the constraints of the given information and is the most logical solution.
Question: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother." This is the best answer because it satisfies the conditions given in the question - that the six daughters all have one brother. In this scenario, all the daughters share the same brother, meaning there is only one brother in the family. This would make a total of seven children (6 daughters and 1 brother), along with the parents, totaling nine family members. Therefore, this answer fits all the conditions given in the question and provides a logical explanation for the situation.

Question  49
Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine would have the capability to intentionally sink a ship without the need for a storm or mechanical issue. This explanation is also supported by the fact that the ship sank in front of onlookers and that there were no unusual circumstances such as too many fish or too many spectators in the harbor. Therefore, the presence of a submarine seems like the most logical explanation for the ship's sudden sinking.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires" because reducing the air pressure in the tires would lower the overall height of the semi, allowing it to free itself from the overpass. This solution does not require any extreme measures like lifting or overturning the truck and is a practical and effective way to resolve the issue.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.

Question  50
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the possibility of a stone growing and producing fruit, by explaining that the "stone" was actually a seed. The explanation about the seed of a cherry being called a stone provides a logical and scientific explanation for the phenomenon, making it the most plausible and accurate option.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: Two women and two doctors walk into an ice cream parlor. They each order an ice cream cone. When their ice cream come, there is only 1 strawberry,1 chocolate and 1 vanilla. How come they didn't complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the women was a doctor.', "The ice creams are big enough for more than one people, so the shop think they won't complain.", "One of them is kind and didn't complain even though the shop forgets hers.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the women was a doctor." This is because being a doctor implies a level of understanding and patience, and the presence of a doctor in the group may have influenced the others to not complain about the ice cream flavors. It is also a subtle reference to the stereotype of doctors being more understanding and less likely to cause a scene in public places.
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the seemingly impossible scenario described in the question. It explains that the "stone" was actually a seed, and that the fruit and leaves sprouting from it is a natural result of it being a seed and not an actual stone. This answer aligns with scientific knowledge and botanical terminology, making it the most plausible explanation.
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: A store has on sale a computer and word processor small enough to fit in your pocket. It can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write in all languages. A delete device will correct any error. No electricity is required to operate it. The price? Only a few cents! How can the store make a profit by selling it so cheap? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser." This is because the description matches that of a pencil, which can add (write), multiply (repeated writing), subtract (erase), and divide (separate words or numbers), and can write in all languages. The "delete device" refers to the eraser. The store can make a profit by selling it so cheap because the cost of producing a pencil is low, allowing for a high profit margin even with a low sale price.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: A guy was just going about his business when his suit was ripped. Why did he pass away three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't afford to buy a new one.", "He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it provides a logical reason for his passing away three minutes later - the lack of a properly functioning suit in the vacuum of space would have led to rapid decompression and ultimately his demise. The other answer choices do not offer a reasonable explanation for his sudden passing.
Question: In a remote village, a wise traveler decides to check out local dental implants. There are only two dentists in the village, each with a clinic. Glance at the first clinic and see that the dentist's own teeth are badly planted and his salon is poorly maintained. The second salon is tidy, the dentist's teeth are well planted and his attire is spotless. Why smart travelers choose dental implants in the first clinic? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentisit who had given his rival the better implants.", 'The traveler chose the first dentist because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the dentist was so busy.', 'The traveler went to the first dentist because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentist who had given his rival the better implants." This is the best answer because it suggests that the reason why the first dentist's teeth were poorly planted is because he had been busy giving the second dentist a better set of implants. It explains why the first dentist's salon was untidy and his own teeth poorly placed, leading the smart traveler to choose the first dentist for his own dental implants.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.
Question: They were eight students, taking an exam with nobody else inside the room. when the time was up, they were only 7 taken tests. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the students was a examiner.', 'Two students had the same answer, so they just handed in one paper.', 'One student handed in a blank paper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the students was an examiner." This is the best answer because if one of the students was an examiner, then there were actually only 7 students taking the exam. The examiner would not need to hand in a test paper, which explains why there were only 7 tests turned in.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.', 'Two girls filled the from together.', 'One mother is too old to apply for new IDs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother" because it explains that there are three individuals - a grandmother, her daughter (the mother), and her granddaughter (the daughter). This aligns with the given scenario of two mothers and two daughters, as well as the agent only giving out three forms, as each person is represented. The other answer choices do not accurately address the relationship dynamics of the individuals in the scenario.
Question: A man uses the elevator since he is too old to use his crutch to ascend to the 12th floor. He is asked to hit the 17th button by a woman who is taller than him because she is unable to do it herself. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch.', 'The old man was granted exclusive access to the higher floors.', 'The woman thinks pressing the 17th button in the elevator brings good luck or wards off bad luck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and practical reason for why the woman asked the old man to press the 17th button - because he can reach it with the help of his crutch, while she cannot reach it herself. It also explains the situation in a way that makes sense given the man's physical limitations and the woman's need for assistance.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am a dentist.', 'I am a theif.', 'I am a miner.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I am a dentist." This is because the clues in the description point to activities that a dentist would engage in, such as excavating little caves (referring to cavities in teeth), keeping gold and silver there (referring to fillings), creating gold crowns and silver bridges (referring to dental crowns and bridges), and the reluctance of people to accept assistance from a dentist. This all points to the profession of dentistry.

Question  51
Question: Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that the girls did not get wet because there was no rain. This explanation is simple, clear, and directly addresses the situation described in the question. The other answer choices introduce additional scenarios or assumptions that are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, "Because it was not raining" is the most logical and direct explanation for why the girls did not get wet while using the same umbrella.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A logical with some time to kill in a small town decided to get a haircut. The town had only two barber, each with his own shop. The logical glance into one shop and saw that it was extremely until. The barber needed a shave, his clothes were unkempt, and his hair was badly cut. The other shop was extremely neat. The barber was freshly shaved and spotlessly dressed, his hair neatly trimmed. Why did the logical return to the first shop for his haircut? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: I have a friend who claims that he has a especial kite that it's 10 kilograms, however, he can throw it towards a direction and at some point that he can say exactly when, the kite will change directions and comes straight back to him. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Your friend has developed a unique technique using specialized magnetic attachments on the kite and a powerful electromagnet placed at a specific location.', 'The kite is too heavy to fly so the only reasonable answer is that the kite is always thrown towards the sky and because of its weight, it can be expected that at a particular time, it wil change directions and comes straight back to him.', 'The kite your friend has is made of a special material that is lighter than air. Despite its weight being stated as 10 kilograms, it actually has negative mass, allowing it to defy gravity. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The kite is too heavy to fly so the only reasonable answer is that the kite is always thrown towards the sky and because of its weight, it can be expected that at a particular time, it will change directions and come straight back to him." This is the best answer because it explains the phenomenon using the principle of gravity and the weight of the kite. The kite's weight makes it difficult to maintain flight, causing it to eventually change direction and return to the ground.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.

Best Answer: The best answer is "She had already put sugar in it and when she tasted the new tea it was already sweet." This is the best answer because the woman had already put sugar in her original tea, and when she tasted the new tea, she realized that it was already sweet, indicating that it was the same tea. This method is a clear and direct way for the woman to determine that it was the same tea, making it the best answer.

Answer Choices: ['There came a big cloud which covered the sun for several minutes.', "A woman's skin is thick enough to withstand the sun's rays", 'Because they were all married and not single.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a creative and unexpected twist to the question, as the typical assumption would be related to the physical environment or the characteristics of the women. By stating that they didn't get sunburnt because they were all married, it adds a humorous and unexpected element to the answer, making it the best choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.

Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off.

Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.

This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: A certain large animal lives happily and thrives here on Earth. One day, every single one of these writers is wiped out by a mysterious disease that affects only this particular animal. There are none left anywhere on earth -- they are all gone. About a year or so later, they begin to reappear on Earth again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the mule" because mules are born sterile, so they cannot reproduce naturally. This means that if every single mule were to be wiped out, there would be no way for them to reappear on Earth without human intervention to crossbreed donkeys and horses. Therefore, the reappearance of mules on Earth after being wiped out is not possible without human intervention.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.

Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: There lived a man in a house and every time he went to bed he turned on the light. One night, the man forgot to turn on the light. The next day he read the paper and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because living in a lighthouse means he is responsible for ensuring the light is on to guide ships safely. Forgetting to turn on the light led to a ship crashing, causing the man to feel deep self-blame after reading about the incident in the newspaper.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse."

This is the best answer because it explains how the couple could be positioned on the same mat but still not face to face. The man could be on one side of the door, pleading for forgiveness, while the woman was on the other side, still upset and unwilling to talk. This scenario makes sense given the context of the disagreement.

Question  53
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: In an ancient village, 30 warriors are equipped with 30 spears. They encountered a stash of 30 golden coins. Each took one, and yet there were still 29 left. How could this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some warriors sold their spears to exchange new golden coins.', "Each is the name of one of the warriors, and he's the only one who took a coin.", 'Several warriors refused to take golden coins as the action was implite.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the warriors, and he's the only one who took a coin." This is because the riddle is referring to the individual names of the warriors, with "Each" being one of the specific warriors who took a coin. Therefore, when it says "and yet there were still 29 left," it is referring to the remaining warriors who did not take a coin. This explanation fits the riddle's scenario and provides a logical solution.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $35. Adding the cost of the perfume ($5), the total loss for the woman is $40. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" is the most accurate representation of the woman's loss in this situation.
Question: A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass is too heavy.', 'There is no wine in the glass.', 'Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no wine in the glass." This is the best answer because if there is no wine in the glass, then there is nothing to spill even if the glass is knocked over. This explanation accounts for the fact that not a single drop of wine leaked despite the glass being swung off the table. Therefore, this is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the security and succeeded in the end.', 'At that time, he was just walking down the street. He stolen from others previously.', 'The people whom he had stolen is kind and rich.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.

Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is that "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.

Question  54
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket." This is the best answer because it follows the given conditions - each girl gets an apple, and one apple remains in the basket. This solution does not involve sharing or returning the apple, ensuring that each girl gets an apple and one remains in the basket.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the conditions given in the question - that all of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. This means she must have one cat and one dog, as stated in the answer choice. This is the only answer choice that fits all the conditions given in the question.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery. In the operating room, a doctor came in and looked at the little boy and said I can't operate on him he is my son. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is the best answer because it challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions. The doctor being the mother of the son defies the stereotype that only men can be doctors, showcasing the importance of breaking down societal biases and expectations.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: A person was outside when it started snowing heavily. Even though he was directly exposed to the snowfall without any protection, not a single snowflake landed on his hair. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'The man succeeded in avoiding all snow flake.', 'He is bold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bold." This is because the scenario described in the question is likely a play on the phrase "not a hair out of place," meaning the person managed to avoid being affected by the heavy snowfall despite being directly exposed to it. It is a clever twist on the traditional idea of not a single hair being out of place, and the answer "He is bold" plays on this clever wordplay.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day." This is because the question implies that Wednesday, Tom, and Joe were the ones having dinner, and the riddle suggests that Joe and Tom did not have to pay, leaving the implication that Wednesday, the unnamed third person, must have been the one who paid the bill. This answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for how the bill was covered.

Question  55
Question: Which would you light first if you were alone in a dark room with just one match with an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to select from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Candle.', 'Oil.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because if you were alone in a dark room with just one match, it would be more logical to use the match to try to find an exit or light switch, rather than risking using it to light any of the three options. Lighting any of the options would also not guarantee an immediate source of light for finding your way out of the room. Therefore, it's best to conserve the match and use it to navigate the dark room instead.
Question: If we have two bulls, and each cow can produce two gallons of milk every day. How much milk do we have after 2 days? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Eight.', 'Four.', 'Sixteen.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above" because the information provided does not specify the number of cows. Without knowing the number of cows, we cannot accurately calculate the total amount of milk produced in 2 days. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of milk produced with the information given.
Question: A man is a chef with five dishes to make in half an hour: Crispy Smashed Potatoes, Picadillo, Zuppa Toscana, Classic Pot Roast, and also potatoes. Which one does he have to make first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Classic Pot Roast.', 'Picadillo.', 'Crispy Smashed Potatoes.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the chef needs to prioritize his time based on cooking methods and timings rather than the specific dishes. For example, the Crispy Smashed Potatoes and Classic Pot Roast might require longer cooking times compared to the Picadillo or Zuppa Toscana. Therefore, he should prioritize dishes that require longer cooking times first to ensure everything is ready on time.
Question: A PC has a bomb on top of it. A phone, a comb, keys, and a cup are arranged around the computer. Which object is destroyed first when the explosion occurs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The phone.', 'The hairbush.', 'The cup.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above." The explosion would likely destroy all the objects simultaneously, as they are all in close proximity to the bomb. The force of the explosion would be powerful enough to affect all the objects at the same time, rather than destroying one before the others. Therefore, none of the objects would be destroyed first.
Question:  Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The way to the pond.', 'Home.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question does not specify the location of the rest of the ducks. It only provides information about five ducks getting lost, thirteen staying home, and nine being at the pond. Therefore, we cannot determine the location of the rest of the ducks based on the given information.
Question:  Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Home.', 'The way to the pond.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because it does not fit any of the given options. The question does not provide a specific location for the remaining ducks, so we cannot determine where they are from the information given. Therefore, "None of above" is the most accurate answer.
Question: If a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird are racing to the top of a coconut tree, who will get the banana first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'The bird.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question mentions a coconut tree, which does not produce bananas. Therefore, none of the animals will be able to get a banana from the coconut tree. This answer takes into account the specifics of the question and the characteristics of the animals and the tree mentioned.
Question: Ten fish are in a tank. Two fish drown. Four fish swim away.Three fish die.
How many fish are left in the tank? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven.', 'Five.', 'Twenty.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above." While the scenario presents a situation where some fish are removed or die, it is not possible for fish to "drown" or "swim away" as these actions only apply to creatures outside of water. Therefore, the concept of fish "drowning" or "swimming away" is logically impossible, and therefore none of the answer choices accurately reflect the situation described.
Question: A group of ten ostriches are in a field. If four of them take off flying, how many are left in the field? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." Ostriches are flightless birds, so it is impossible for them to take off flying. Therefore, all ten ostriches would still be left in the field. This choice is the best because it accurately reflects the biology of ostriches and the impossibility of them flying.
Question: A grenade is in a shopping bag. Around the bag, there is a smartphone, a wallet, a bottle of water, and a book. When the detonation occurs, which item is damaged first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The wallet.', 'The book.', 'The smartphone.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because none of the items listed have the ability to withstand a grenade detonation without being damaged. While the smartphone and wallet may provide some level of protection to the items inside the bag, ultimately, the force and shrapnel from the explosion would damage all the items simultaneously. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which item would be damaged first.
Question: Ten chickens are gathered in a field. How many of them remain on the field if four of them take off flying? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because the question asks how many chickens remain on the field after four of them take off flying. Therefore, if four chickens take off flying, none of them remain on the field. Therefore, the correct answer is "None of above."
Question: A tank contains ten fish. Two fish drown. Four fish are swimming away.Three fish perish. How many fish are there left in the tank? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven.', 'Twenty.', 'Five.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because fish do not drown, they also do not perish, and it is not mentioned that any fish are removed from the tank. Therefore, all ten fish are still in the tank even though some might be swimming away.
Question: How can you lift an elephant with one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Crane.', 'Forklift.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." because it is physically impossible to lift an elephant with one hand, regardless of the equipment used. Elephants are extremely heavy animals, with adult elephants weighing several thousand pounds. Even with the most advanced technology or strong machinery, it is not possible for a human to lift an elephant with just one hand. Therefore, the best answer is that it cannot be done.
Question: How to carry an elephant on one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Forklift.', 'Crane.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." It is not physically possible to carry an elephant on one hand, regardless of the equipment or tools mentioned. Elephants are extremely heavy, with an average weight of around 8,000 to 12,000 pounds, and cannot be lifted by a single human hand. Therefore, the best answer is to acknowledge that it is not possible to carry an elephant on one hand.
Question: We have 5 roosters and each one gives 1 egg per day. How many eggs do we have after a week? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Five.', 'Thirty-five.', 'Seven.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. Therefore, the question contains a mistake and none of the provided answer choices are correct.
Question: If you were alone in a dark room, with only one match and an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to choose from, which would you light first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Oil.', 'Candle.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because before I light any of the options, I should first light the match in order to be able to light anything else. Therefore, the first step would be to light the match itself.
Question: Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The bird.', 'The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above" because coconut trees do not bear bananas, so none of the animals would be able to grab a banana. This answer is the most logical and accurate based on the information given in the question.
Question: Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Dolphin.', 'Dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is None of above. This is because all three animals have different levels of hearing abilities, and the ability to hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room would depend on various factors such as the frequency range of the sound and the sensitivity of their auditory system. Without specific information on the decibel level or frequency of the quietest sound, it is impossible to determine which animal would hear it. Therefore, it is most accurate to say that none of the animals listed would definitively hear the quietest sound without more specific information.
Question: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Tiger.', 'Owl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because none of the given choices (tiger, bat, or owl) can see in complete darkness. While bats and owls have better night vision compared to many other animals, they still rely on low light levels to see, and cannot see in complete darkness. Therefore, none of the given choices can see in complete darkness.
Question: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Owl.', 'Tiger.', 'Bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." While owls have excellent night vision, they cannot see in total darkness. Bats use echolocation to navigate in darkness but cannot "see" in the traditional sense. Tigers have good vision but cannot see in total darkness. Therefore, none of the given options can see most clearly in total darkness.
Question: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Owl.', 'Tiger.', 'Bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "None of above" because none of the given options (bat, tiger, or owl) can see most clearly in total darkness. While bats use echolocation to navigate in darkness, it does not provide a visual image. Tigers have good vision but cannot see in total darkness. Owls have excellent night vision, but they also cannot see in total darkness. Therefore, none of the given options can see most clearly in total darkness.

Question  56
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption.', 'All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The airplane required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption." This is the best answer because turbulence can cause disruptions in electrical signals, including those transmitting music to Linda's headphones. No other answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the sudden interruption and subsequent resumption of the music.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.

Question  57
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.

Question  58
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the seemingly impossible scenario described in the question. It explains that the "stone" was actually a seed, and that the fruit and leaves sprouting from it is a natural result of it being a seed and not an actual stone. This answer aligns with scientific knowledge and botanical terminology, making it the most plausible explanation.
Question: Bouncing Bob was riding a particularly risky horse when suddenly its bridge came off. As they raced down the road, a screaming Bob lung to the horse's ears for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye, Bob saw a car coming, and realizing the horse was completely out of control, he panicked. Failing his arms about, he accidentally caused the horse to come to an abrupt halt. What could Bouncing Bob have done to make the horse stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is because covering a horse's eyes will disorient and startle the horse, causing it to stop. Horses rely heavily on their vision, so obstructing their ability to see is an effective way to make them stop. All the other options involve physical actions that are not guaranteed to make the horse stop, while covering the horse's eyes interferes with its primary sense and is highly likely to cause it to halt.
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: A guy was just going about his business when his suit was ripped. Why did he pass away three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't afford to buy a new one.", "He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it provides a logical reason for his passing away three minutes later - the lack of a properly functioning suit in the vacuum of space would have led to rapid decompression and ultimately his demise. The other answer choices do not offer a reasonable explanation for his sudden passing.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: Although they were born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were not born in the same year.', 'One student ran away from home at a young age.', 'One student had a bad academic grades and broken up with his parents.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were not born in the same year." This is because it is the most logical explanation for two students who are otherwise unrelated to share the same birthday. It is entirely conceivable that two unrelated students could be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, especially in a large school with many students. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for this situation is that the students were born on the same day of the same month but in different years.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: In a remote village, a wise traveler decides to check out local dental implants. There are only two dentists in the village, each with a clinic. Glance at the first clinic and see that the dentist's own teeth are badly planted and his salon is poorly maintained. The second salon is tidy, the dentist's teeth are well planted and his attire is spotless. Why smart travelers choose dental implants in the first clinic? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentisit who had given his rival the better implants.", 'The traveler chose the first dentist because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the dentist was so busy.', 'The traveler went to the first dentist because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentist who had given his rival the better implants." This is the best answer because it suggests that the reason why the first dentist's teeth were poorly planted is because he had been busy giving the second dentist a better set of implants. It explains why the first dentist's salon was untidy and his own teeth poorly placed, leading the smart traveler to choose the first dentist for his own dental implants.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: There were two bosses and two employees in a meeting room discussing different tasks. At the end of the meeting, there three tasks for all the people in that meeting. How is that possible Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss.", 'One boss gaves his fish to his employee.', 'Two employees shared the same task.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss." This explanation allows for two bosses and two employees in the meeting. One of the employees is also a boss, which can account for the three tasks assigned at the end of the meeting. This scenario logically explains how the situation is possible.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Matthew is a deep-sea diver.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Matthew was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Matthew is a deep-sea diver" because his behavior of making plans to visit a deep spot and plunging into profound depths indicates that he has experience and comfort with deep-sea diving. His lack of injury or harm may be attributed to his training, experience, and knowledge of safe diving practices. This explanation aligns with his behavior and the lack of harm despite his risky behavior.

Question  59
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $35. Adding the cost of the perfume ($5), the total loss for the woman is $40. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" is the most accurate representation of the woman's loss in this situation.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: Despite being in December, David's birthday is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December falls in the summer instead of winter. Therefore, David's birthday is never in the winter because he lives in a location where December is a summer month.
Question: A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass is too heavy.', 'There is no wine in the glass.', 'Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no wine in the glass." This is the best answer because if there is no wine in the glass, then there is nothing to spill even if the glass is knocked over. This explanation accounts for the fact that not a single drop of wine leaked despite the glass being swung off the table. Therefore, this is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: Despite being in June, David's birthday is never in the summer. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where the seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, June in Australia is actually in the winter season, not summer. This means that David's birthday, despite being in June, does not fall in the summer season.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.
Question: On July 4, a girl traveled to the United States to party for three days before returning on July 4. How did she manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'July 7th is holiday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it logically explains how the girl was able to party in the United States for three days before returning on July 4. This answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible explanation for the girl's travel plans. None of the other answer choices offer a practical or realistic explanation for how the girl managed to party in the United States for three days before returning on the same date.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: In 1898, a guy was born. He is still living at the age of 33.  How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old.', 'he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.', 'His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was born in room 1898 in the hospital." This answer gives a logical explanation for how someone could be born in 1898 and still be living at the age of 33. It suggests that the person was born in a specific room named "1898" in a hospital, rather than being born in the year 1898. This cleverly resolves the apparent contradiction and provides a plausible explanation for the person's age.
Question: A boy accidentally walked into a 10-foot deep pool, yet he didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pool is too deep.', 'The pool was empty.', 'The pool is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The pool was empty." This is because if the pool was empty, there would be no water for the boy to get wet. It would simply be a hole in the ground, and the boy could walk into it without getting wet. This explanation logically accounts for the boy not getting wet despite walking into a 10-foot deep pool.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: How could a cowboy ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the cowboy could ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday. It implies that the cowboy's horse is named after the day of the week, allowing for the discrepancy in the timeline.
Question: How could a cowboy ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the cowboy could ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday. It implies that the cowboy's horse is named after the day of the week, allowing for the discrepancy in the timeline. This explanation fits the given scenario and resolves the apparent contradiction in the cowboy's travel schedule.

Question  60
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['May 6th is holiday.', 'He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.', 'The boy drank a lot and slept at festival for 5 days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: Four men sat down to play, They played all night till the break of day. They played for gold and not for fun, With separate scores for every one. When they had come to square accounts, They all had made quite fair amounts. Can you explain the paradox, If no one lost, how all could gain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because the paradox described in the riddle can only be resolved if the men were playing musical instruments and making music, rather than engaging in a game of chance or skill like poker or mining for gold. In this case, they would have played music and earned money through their performance, allowing them all to make fair amounts without anyone losing.
Question: A knock on the door is heard by the woman while she is seated in her hotel room. When she opens the door, she is greeted by a stranger. I'm sorry, I made a mistake; I thought this was my room, he apologizes. He then exits the elevator and walks down the hall. The woman returns to her room and makes a security call. What gave the woman cause to be so wary of the man? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman knows this man on the newspaper.', 'If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.\n', 'The woman thought the man is rude.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first." This is the best answer because it shows that the man's behavior was suspicious and not consistent with someone trying to enter their own room. Instead of trying to enter with his key, he knocked on the door, which raised the woman's suspicion and prompted her to make a security call.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: There was once a bad wizard. He abducted three women from their homes and transformed them into identical rose plants. They were placed in his garden. One of the women pleaded with the magician to allow her to see her husband and kids. He concurred. He took the woman to her home at night. He arrived early in the morning and drove her home. The spouse made the decision to go get her one day. He entered the wizard's garden as a result. He kept glancing at the three identical rose bushes, trying to determine which one might be his wife. He took his wife home as soon as he realized the solution. How did he recognize his wife among the rosebushes? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew" because the husband was able to recognize his wife among the rosebushes by noticing that she was the only plant without dew, as she had been inside the house during the night. This detail allowed him to distinguish her from the other identical rose plants.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.

Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the situation described in the scenario, where Bob unintentionally brought the horse to a standstill by flailing his arms around. By covering the horse's eyes, it would have caused confusion and disorientation for the horse, leading it to naturally stop. This action aligns with the scenario and the outcome described, making it the most suitable answer.
Question: A girl slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry." This is the best answer because if the well did not have any water in it, then the girl would not have gotten wet when she fell in. This explanation makes logical sense and is the most reasonable explanation for how the girl did not get wet after falling into the well. Therefore, "The well is dry" is the best answer.
Question: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because roosters don't lay eggs.", 'His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.', 'Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the issue of not getting any eggs from the roosters. It explains that the farmer did not receive any eggs because roosters are not capable of laying eggs, as only hens can lay eggs. Therefore, it provides a logical and straightforward explanation for the farmer's lack of eggs despite providing food for the roosters.
Question: A store has on sale a computer and word processor small enough to fit in your pocket. It can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write in all languages. A delete device will correct any error. No electricity is required to operate it. The price? Only a few cents! How can the store make a profit by selling it so cheap? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser." This is because the description matches that of a pencil, which can add (write), multiply (repeated writing), subtract (erase), and divide (separate words or numbers), and can write in all languages. The "delete device" refers to the eraser. The store can make a profit by selling it so cheap because the cost of producing a pencil is low, allowing for a high profit margin even with a low sale price.
Question: A man was born in 1898. He is still alive now at the age 33  How is this possible ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.', 'He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old.', 'His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was born in room 1898 in the hospital" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation. The statement "He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old" does not explain how he could still be alive at the age of 33, and "His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years" does not make sense as it would only make him 8 years old in leap years. Therefore, the explanation that he was born in room 1898 in the hospital is the most likely reason for his longevity.
Question: A man was staring out a sixth-floor window when he decided to jump. He did not perish or get any injuries. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt.', 'He used the collision between his body and walls to slow down.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it." because it provides a logical explanation for why the man did not perish or get injured after jumping from the sixth floor. If he was outside the window to wash it, then he would have been attached to a safety harness or rope, which would have prevented him from falling to the ground. This explanation is the most plausible and realistic, given the circumstances described.
Question: Why you go to gym everyday, but still can't do a marathon in New York. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since you're not in new york to do the marathon", 'The marathon in New York is expensive and unaffordable.', 'You will need government permission to do marathon in New York.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "since you're not in New York to do the marathon" because it directly addresses the contradiction between going to the gym every day and not being able to do a marathon in New York. It suggests that the reason for not being able to do the marathon is due to the location, not because of any lack of physical fitness or training. This answer provides a clear and logical explanation for the situation.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: How can you enter a exam session and have the answers sooner than everybody else in the room? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['You have to be a teacher.', 'You have to prepate for the whole year.', 'You have to ask teacher for the asnwer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "You have to be a teacher." This is because as a teacher, you would have access to the exam questions and answers before the students, giving you the advantage of knowing the answers sooner than everyone else in the room. This is the only option that directly addresses having an unfair advantage in the exam session.
Question: Three people are stuck inside a dark cave. The first fears the complete darkness, the second fears bats, and the third fears getting lost. They don't have any flashlights, lanterns or any kind of light source, and their cell phones have no signal so they can't use them as a light source either. How do they get out of the cave? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.", 'They run over around the whole cave and find the way out.', 'They try to run away from the bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the problem of darkness without any light sources. If it's daytime outside the cave, there will be natural light, which allows them to navigate and find their way out without being hindered by their fears. This solution also does not involve any unnecessary or dangerous actions, making it the safest and most practical option.
Question: There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person already at the south side of the river.', 'They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." because it is the only plausible explanation given the constraints of the situation. Since the riddle states that only one person can fit on the boat, and there is no mention of the person being able to swim or another boat being available, the only logical conclusion is that there was already someone on the south side of the river. Therefore, this answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible solution to the riddle.
Question: Assume you're in a room with no doors, windows, or anything else. How do you escape? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario provided is impossible and does not represent a real situation. Therefore, the only way to escape is to stop imagining the scenario and focus on real solutions to real problems. There is no practical way to escape a room with no doors or windows.
Question: Each and every day, a man gets up early to work out. He always spends a few hours running about his apartments. He surprises himself by discovering that, after a month of hard training, his left leg has acquired much more muscle than his right. How is that feasible since the man is normal and healthy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than inside leg.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'He may have a subtle bias or preference for using his right leg more than his left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than the inside leg." This is the best answer because when running in a circular clockwise direction, the outer leg (the left leg in this case) will cover a greater distance than the inner leg due to the arc of the circle. This discrepancy in distance covered by each leg could lead to the left leg gaining more muscle mass than the right. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why the left leg acquired more muscle after a month of hard training.
Question: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.", 'There was a one-week long holidays.', 'He fiies straightly for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday" because it is a clever and humorous play on words. It is physically impossible to take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday without manipulating time or having a plane with a unique name like "Tuesday." This answer provides a creative and lighthearted explanation for the impossible scenario.
Question: In a grocery store, a man fills a shopping basket. He walks out of the store without paying, and no one stops him or calls the cops. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and without anyone stopping him. It also aligns with a plausible scenario in a grocery store setting.
Question:  A hiker arrives near a lake. He sees a sign where it is written "No swimming allowed.", but the duck jumps into the water. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because ducks can't read.", "Because ducks won't polluted water.", 'Because ducks are tiny to be detected.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because ducks can't read." simply because ducks are not capable of understanding written signs or regulations. The other options do not provide a logical explanation as to why the duck would ignore the sign. Ducks being unable to read is the most straightforward and reasonable explanation for the duck's behavior.
Question: How was it possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is because the question is asking how it was possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday. The explanation is that the cowboy's horse is named Wednesday, so when he arrives in town on Friday, stays for Saturday and Sunday, and leaves on Wednesday, it appears as though he stayed for two days, when in reality he stayed for five days.
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food," because if the rope is not tied to anything, it would not restrict the horse's movement, allowing it to reach the food 15 meters away. This is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the horse was able to reach its food despite being tethered to a 5-meter long rope.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that penguins and their eggs are not available in the Arctic, therefore not part of the traditional or cultural diet of the natives. This explanation aligns with the question's emphasis on the natives of the Arctic, ensuring that it specifically addresses why they would not eat a penguin's egg.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because the statement is factually accurate and directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. Therefore, this answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. This explanation provides a logical and straightforward reason for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.

Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.

Answer Choices: ['The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore', "The boss used his phone to hit Mark's head heavily.", 'The boss called the police to tell them how worse the Mark was.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore." This is the best answer because it is a practical and logical solution to stop Mark from coming to the office, and it aligns with the boss's responsibility to manage the workplace. The other options are extreme and inappropriate actions that would not be a suitable response to a bad employee.
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the seemingly impossible scenario described in the question. It explains that the "stone" was actually a seed, and that the fruit and leaves sprouting from it is a natural result of it being a seed and not an actual stone. This answer aligns with scientific knowledge and botanical terminology, making it the most plausible explanation.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.

She wants to build a house on the island and needs to get materials there. She doesn't have a boat, plane, or anything to transport them to the island. How does Sally solve this problem?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.', 'She drives a plane to load all the material she needs to the island.', 'She borrows necessary materials from her neighborhood. Her neighborhood is rich and friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Sally waits to take the materials over during the colder months when the lake freezes over, so she can walk over it. This solution is practical and cost-effective, as she does not need to invest in any transportation methods. Additionally, it allows her to transport the materials without relying on external help or resources. Overall, waiting for the lake to freeze over provides a simple and straightforward solution to Sally's transportation problem.
Question: Bouncing Bob was riding a very dangerous horse when its bridge suddenly collapsed. A screaming Bob sprang for the horse's ears as they sped down the road. Bob spotted a vehicle approaching out of the corner of his eye and worried when he realized the horse was entirely out of control. He unintentionally brought the horse to a standstill by flailing his arms around. What might Bouncing Bob have done to bring the horse to a halt? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the situation described in the scenario, where Bob unintentionally brought the horse to a standstill by flailing his arms around. By covering the horse's eyes, it would have caused confusion and disorientation for the horse, leading it to naturally stop. This action aligns with the scenario and the outcome described, making it the most suitable answer.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: Bouncing Bob was riding a particularly risky horse when suddenly its bridge came off. As they raced down the road, a screaming Bob lung to the horse's ears for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye, Bob saw a car coming, and realizing the horse was completely out of control, he panicked. Failing his arms about, he accidentally caused the horse to come to an abrupt halt. What could Bouncing Bob have done to make the horse stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is because covering a horse's eyes will disorient and startle the horse, causing it to stop. Horses rely heavily on their vision, so obstructing their ability to see is an effective way to make them stop. All the other options involve physical actions that are not guaranteed to make the horse stop, while covering the horse's eyes interferes with its primary sense and is highly likely to cause it to halt.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.', 'Two girls filled the from together.', 'One mother is too old to apply for new IDs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother" because it explains that there are three individuals - a grandmother, her daughter (the mother), and her granddaughter (the daughter). This aligns with the given scenario of two mothers and two daughters, as well as the agent only giving out three forms, as each person is represented. The other answer choices do not accurately address the relationship dynamics of the individuals in the scenario.
Question: Sally lives in an area with a warm summer for six months of the year and a harsh winter for the other six. She has a lake with a tiny island in it. She needs to transport supplies to the island since she wants to build a house there. She lacks a boat, an aircraft, or any other means of transportation to get them to the island. How does Sally deal with this issue? Choose the best answer choice.

Her neighborhood is rich and friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Sally waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, allowing her to walk over it. This is the best answer because it provides a practical and realistic solution to her transportation issue without requiring her to obtain a boat or aircraft. Additionally, it takes into account the natural conditions of her environment, making it a feasible and cost-effective option.
Question: A guy was just going about his business when his suit was ripped. Why did he pass away three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't afford to buy a new one.", "He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it provides a logical reason for his passing away three minutes later - the lack of a properly functioning suit in the vacuum of space would have led to rapid decompression and ultimately his demise. The other answer choices do not offer a reasonable explanation for his sudden passing.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.

The second salon is tidy, the dentist's teeth are well planted and his attire is spotless. Why smart travelers choose dental implants in the first clinic? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentisit who had given his rival the better implants.", 'The traveler chose the first dentist because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the dentist was so busy.', 'The traveler went to the first dentist because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentist who had given his rival the better implants." This is the best answer because it suggests that the reason why the first dentist's teeth were poorly planted is because he had been busy giving the second dentist a better set of implants. It explains why the first dentist's salon was untidy and his own teeth poorly placed, leading the smart traveler to choose the first dentist for his own dental implants.
Question: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am a dentist.', 'I am a theif.', 'I am a miner.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I am a dentist." This is because the clues in the description point to activities that a dentist would engage in, such as excavating little caves (referring to cavities in teeth), keeping gold and silver there (referring to fillings), creating gold crowns and silver bridges (referring to dental crowns and bridges), and the reluctance of people to accept assistance from a dentist. This all points to the profession of dentistry.
Question: A man uses the elevator since he is too old to use his crutch to ascend to the 12th floor. He is asked to hit the 17th button by a woman who is taller than him because she is unable to do it herself. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch.', 'The old man was granted exclusive access to the higher floors.', 'The woman thinks pressing the 17th button in the elevator brings good luck or wards off bad luck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and practical reason for why the woman asked the old man to press the 17th button - because he can reach it with the help of his crutch, while she cannot reach it herself. It also explains the situation in a way that makes sense given the man's physical limitations and the woman's need for assistance.

Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and practical reason for why the woman asked the old man to press the 17th button - because he can reach it with the help of his crutch, while she cannot reach it herself. It also explains the situation in a way that makes sense given the man's physical limitations and the woman's need for assistance.

Question  63
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A boat on the lake included four men. All four men on the boat sink to the bottom of the lake when it flips over. However, not a single man gets wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because they were all married and not single.', 'The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because the question is a play on words - while it initially appears to refer to getting wet with water, it actually refers to being single versus being married. This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.
Question: The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is the best answer because in a doubles tennis match, two players are on each team, and each team can win three sets, resulting in a total of five sets played. Therefore, it is conceivable for each man to win three sets in the five that were played because they were in a doubles match.
Question: Two men were playing tennis. They played five sets and each man won three sets. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'They were playing tennis in turns.', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is because in doubles tennis, two players form a team and play against another team, so it is possible for each man to win three sets. In doubles, the team's combined sets won are counted, so each player winning three sets is entirely possible and would result in a tie. The other answer choices do not provide a plausible explanation for each man winning three sets in a five-set match.
Question: Two men were playing tennis. They played five sets and each man won three sets. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'They were playing tennis in turns.', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." In a doubles tennis match, two players form a team and play against another team. Therefore, it is possible for each man to win three sets, resulting in a tie for the overall match. This explanation is the most plausible and logical given the scenario described in the question.

Answer Choices: ['The way to the pond.', 'Home.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question does not specify the location of the rest of the ducks. It only provides information about five ducks getting lost, thirteen staying home, and nine being at the pond. Therefore, we cannot determine the location of the rest of the ducks based on the given information.
Question:  Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Home.', 'The way to the pond.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because it does not fit any of the given options. The question does not provide a specific location for the remaining ducks, so we cannot determine where they are from the information given. Therefore, "None of above" is the most accurate answer.
Question: If you were alone in a dark room, with only one match and an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to choose from, which would you light first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Oil.', 'Candle.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because before I light any of the options, I should first light the match in order to be able to light anything else. Therefore, the first step would be to light the match itself.
Question: How can you lift an elephant with one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Crane.', 'Forklift.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." because it is physically impossible to lift an elephant with one hand, regardless of the equipment used. Elephants are extremely heavy animals, with adult elephants weighing several thousand pounds. Even with the most advanced technology or strong machinery, it is not possible for a human to lift an elephant with just one hand. Therefore, the best answer is that it cannot be done.
Question: There were 10 pigeons sitting in a row. A tiger came and caught one of them and ate it. How many pigeons are left for the tiger to eat? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Nine.', 'One.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is the best answer because when the tiger caught and ate one pigeon, the act of eating does not change the quantity of the remaining pigeons. So, all 10 pigeons are still left for the tiger to eat.
Question: A group of ten ostriches are in a field. If four of them take off flying, how many are left in the field? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." Ostriches are flightless birds, so it is impossible for them to take off flying. Therefore, all ten ostriches would still be left in the field. This choice is the best because it accurately reflects the biology of ostriches and the impossibility of them flying.
Question: We have 5 roosters and each one gives 1 egg per day. How many eggs do we have after a week? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Five.', 'Thirty-five.', 'Seven.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. Therefore, the question contains a mistake and none of the provided answer choices are correct.
Question: A rooster and a bull were expecting their first child, but since they were having a competition, they wanted to precipitate the process. Which one of them gave birth first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rooster.', 'The bull.', '\nBoth, they happen to finish at the same time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." because neither a rooster nor a bull can give birth. They are both male animals and cannot give birth to offspring. Therefore, the idea of them competing to give birth is not possible, making the answer "None of above" the most appropriate choice.
Question: Ten chickens are gathered in a field. How many of them remain on the field if four of them take off flying? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because the question asks how many chickens remain on the field after four of them take off flying. Therefore, if four chickens take off flying, none of them remain on the field. Therefore, the correct answer is "None of above."
Question: How to carry an elephant on one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Forklift.', 'Crane.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." It is not physically possible to carry an elephant on one hand, regardless of the equipment or tools mentioned. Elephants are extremely heavy, with an average weight of around 8,000 to 12,000 pounds, and cannot be lifted by a single human hand. Therefore, the best answer is to acknowledge that it is not possible to carry an elephant on one hand.
Question: If a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird are racing to the top of a coconut tree, who will get the banana first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'The bird.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question mentions a coconut tree, which does not produce bananas. Therefore, none of the animals will be able to get a banana from the coconut tree. This answer takes into account the specifics of the question and the characteristics of the animals and the tree mentioned.
Question: Which would you light first if you were alone in a dark room with just one match with an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to select from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Candle.', 'Oil.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because if you were alone in a dark room with just one match, it would be more logical to use the match to try to find an exit or light switch, rather than risking using it to light any of the three options. Lighting any of the options would also not guarantee an immediate source of light for finding your way out of the room. Therefore, it's best to conserve the match and use it to navigate the dark room instead.
Question: There is a bomb on top of a computer. Around the computer there is a phone, a hairbrush, keys and a cup. When the explosion comes which item is destroyed first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The phone.', 'The cup.', 'The hairbush.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." Since the location of the bomb is on top of the computer, none of the items surrounding it would be directly impacted by the explosion. The items around the computer may be affected by the force of the explosion, but none of them would be destroyed first. Therefore, the most accurate choice is "None of above."
Question: A man is a chef with five dishes to make in half an hour: Crispy Smashed Potatoes, Picadillo, Zuppa Toscana, Classic Pot Roast, and also potatoes. Which one does he have to make first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Classic Pot Roast.', 'Picadillo.', 'Crispy Smashed Potatoes.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the chef needs to prioritize his time based on cooking methods and timings rather than the specific dishes. For example, the Crispy Smashed Potatoes and Classic Pot Roast might require longer cooking times compared to the Picadillo or Zuppa Toscana. Therefore, he should prioritize dishes that require longer cooking times first to ensure everything is ready on time.
Question: A grenade is in a shopping bag. Around the bag, there is a smartphone, a wallet, a bottle of water, and a book. When the detonation occurs, which item is damaged first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The wallet.', 'The book.', 'The smartphone.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because none of the items listed have the ability to withstand a grenade detonation without being damaged. While the smartphone and wallet may provide some level of protection to the items inside the bag, ultimately, the force and shrapnel from the explosion would damage all the items simultaneously. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which item would be damaged first.
Question: A tank contains ten fish. Two fish drown. Four fish are swimming away.Three fish perish. How many fish are there left in the tank? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven.', 'Twenty.', 'Five.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because fish do not drown, they also do not perish, and it is not mentioned that any fish are removed from the tank. Therefore, all ten fish are still in the tank even though some might be swimming away.
Question: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Tiger.', 'Owl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because none of the given choices (tiger, bat, or owl) can see in complete darkness. While bats and owls have better night vision compared to many other animals, they still rely on low light levels to see, and cannot see in complete darkness. Therefore, none of the given choices can see in complete darkness.
Question: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Owl.', 'Tiger.', 'Bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." While owls have excellent night vision, they cannot see in total darkness. Bats use echolocation to navigate in darkness but cannot "see" in the traditional sense. Tigers have good vision but cannot see in total darkness. Therefore, none of the given options can see most clearly in total darkness.
Question: Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The bird.', 'The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above" because coconut trees do not bear bananas, so none of the animals would be able to grab a banana. This answer is the most logical and accurate based on the information given in the question.
Question: Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Dolphin.', 'Dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is None of above. This is because all three animals have different levels of hearing abilities, and the ability to hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room would depend on various factors such as the frequency range of the sound and the sensitivity of their auditory system. Without specific information on the decibel level or frequency of the quietest sound, it is impossible to determine which animal would hear it. Therefore, it is most accurate to say that none of the animals listed would definitively hear the quietest sound without more specific information.
Question: Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Dolphin.', 'Dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "None of above" because without specific information on the decibel level or frequency of the quietest sound, it is impossible to determine which animal would hear it. Each animal has different levels of hearing abilities, and the ability to hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room would depend on various factors such as the frequency range of the sound and the sensitivity of their auditory system. Therefore, it is most accurate to say that none of the animals listed would definitively hear the quietest sound without more specific information.

Question: A man took several shots heavily and even fell down from the hit, but he still survived. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man has a strong ability to heal himself.', 'The man is strong enough.', 'They were whiskey shots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were whiskey shots." because the phrase "took several shots heavily" typically refers to consuming alcoholic beverages, not getting physically shot. Therefore, the man survived because he consumed a large amount of whiskey and not because of any extraordinary physical ability.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: A bus journeying through the desert had six women aboard. Suddenly, the bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere and all six women have to walk under the scorching sun. Yet, not a single woman gets sunburnt! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There came a big cloud which covered the sun for several minutes.', "A woman's skin is thick enough to withstand the sun's rays", 'Because they were all married and not single.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a creative and unexpected twist to the question, as the typical assumption would be related to the physical environment or the characteristics of the women. By stating that they didn't get sunburnt because they were all married, it adds a humorous and unexpected element to the answer, making it the best choice.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.

Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Since the entire house is described as single-story, it is logical to assume that there are no stairs present. This answer aligns with the given information and makes the most sense in the context of a single-story house.
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself. This scenario would allow her to be legally wed to three men without being divorced, enrolled, or separated from any of them.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Only the woman pays attention on the dancer.', 'The dancer is always dancing in front of the woman.', 'The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer." This is the best answer because it explains the presence of the dancer in the room as a projection of the young woman's future aspirations and dreams. It suggests that the dancer is a symbol of the woman's inner desires and ambitions, which only she can see because it is a manifestation of her own thoughts and hopes for the future.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.

Question  66
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['May 6th is holiday.', 'He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.', 'The boy drank a lot and slept at festival for 5 days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'This man is bald.', 'This man walk upside down to avoid rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald" because if Samuel is bald, then he wouldn't have any hair on his head to get wet in the rain. This explains how his clothes got soaked but not a single hair on his head got wet. This is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: Four men sat down to play, They played all night till the break of day. They played for gold and not for fun, With separate scores for every one. When they had come to square accounts, They all had made quite fair amounts. Can you explain the paradox, If no one lost, how all could gain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because the paradox described in the riddle can only be resolved if the men were playing musical instruments and making music, rather than engaging in a game of chance or skill like poker or mining for gold. In this case, they would have played music and earned money through their performance, allowing them all to make fair amounts without anyone losing.
Question: Four men sat down to play, and they played all night until the sun came up. They played for gold, not for pleasure, with individual scores for everyone. They had all earned good money when it came to square accounts. Can you explain the paradox: If no one loses, how can everyone win? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because musicians often play for gold (money) and keep individual scores for their performances. In this case, "playing for gold" refers to performing for money, and "individual scores" refers to the amount of money each musician earned. Therefore, in this context, playing for gold and having individual scores does not necessarily refer to playing a game, but rather to performing music.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.

Question: Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the most feasible and realistic solution given the limited time and resources Andy has. Reflecting sunlight to seek help or breaking the wall would not guarantee a successful escape within the two-day timeframe. Building a dirt pile to reach the window is the most practical and achievable solution.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: One morning a man is leaving on a business trip and finds he left some paperwork at his office. He runs into his office to get it and the night watchman stops him and says, "Sir, don't get on the plane. I had a dream last night that the plane would crash and everyone would die!" The man takes his word and cancels his trip. Sure enough, the plane crashes and everyone dies. The next morning the man gives the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life and then fires him. Why did he fire the watchman that saved his life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The watchman was fired for not warning the man in advance.', 'The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.', 'The man thought one thousand dollars is too much for a reward.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job" because the man gave the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life, indicating that he was grateful for the warning. However, the watchman's primary job was to keep watch and ensure the security of the building, not to be asleep on the job. The man likely fired the watchman for negligence in carrying out his duties, rather than for the warning about the plane crash.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Two chickens were passing by a really hungry tiger. Tiger however, saw them but couldn't reach them. What happened? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tigers usually don't eat chicken in the natural.", 'The tiger was in the zoo.', 'The chickens smell too bad for the hunger tiger to approach.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The tiger was in the zoo." This is the best answer because it explains why the tiger couldn't reach the chickens, as it was likely enclosed in a protected area where it couldn't hunt for food. This scenario is a common occurrence in zoos where tigers are kept safe from potential prey.
Question: A cat was walking pass a security guard when the guard told him not to enter the area since it was restricted. However, the cat passed the security guard without any sense of obedience.Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The cat thought it won't bring danger", "Since cats can't understand humans' language", 'The cat thought it was hard to detect itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since cats can't understand humans' language". This is because cats do not have the ability to understand spoken language, so the cat would not have comprehended the security guard's warning. The cat's lack of obedience can be attributed to its inability to comprehend human communication, rather than a deliberate act of disobedience or calculation of potential danger.
Question: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: [' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs" because it is a biological fact that roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described defies biological reality. This makes the answer the most logically and scientifically correct choice among the options provided.
Question: A logical with some time to kill in a small town decided to get a haircut. The town had only two barber, each with his own shop. The logical glance into one shop and saw that it was extremely until. The barber needed a shave, his clothes were unkempt, and his hair was badly cut. The other shop was extremely neat. The barber was freshly shaved and spotlessly dressed, his hair neatly trimmed. Why did the logical return to the first shop for his haircut? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is because the statement "I can't operate on him. He's my son" indicates that the doctor is the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions, highlighting the importance of diversity and representation in all fields, including medicine.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: Andy is placed in a cell with no windows and a dirt floor. He can't reach the window because it's too high. A shovel is the sole object in the cell. He won't be able to find food or water, and he only has two days to flee or perish. Andy is unable to construct a tunnel since it will take him considerably longer than two days. How will Andy get out of the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy should use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the best answer because it provides a practical and feasible solution for Andy to reach the window and escape within the limited time frame of two days. Breaking the wall of the cell would be noisy and risky, while reflecting sunlight would not guarantee help in time. Creating a dirt pile allows Andy to utilize the resources he has in the cell to escape safely and effectively.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: Within Joshua Tree National Park, a couple is driving. Because there is no light in the area to improve the view, the Joshua Tree National area is well known for its starry sky. The couple travels here for the first time, and the roads are rough. Their vehicle's headlights are damaged. How did they manage to prevent being crushed? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The moonlight can provide additional visibility.', 'It was during the daylight hours.', 'Their eyes have the ability to adapt to low-light conditions over time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." because the question states that the couple is driving, and the roads are rough. Additionally, it mentions that their vehicle's headlights are damaged. In this situation, it is important to consider the context, which is daytime, and the potential solution, which is not related to the couple's vision or the conditions of the area, making this the most appropriate choice.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.

Question: There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Only the woman pays attention on the dancer.', 'The dancer is always dancing in front of the woman.', 'The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer." This is the best answer because it explains the presence of the dancer in the room as a projection of the young woman's future aspirations and dreams. It suggests that the dancer is a symbol of the woman's inner desires and ambitions, which only she can see because it is a manifestation of her own thoughts and hopes for the future.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: Johnson is a famous doctors in the world and benefit mankind greatly. However, he never been to a medical school. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'Johnson is a "doctors" in the academic sense ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnson is a 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it is possible for someone to gain knowledge and expertise in a certain field through self-study, experience, and practical application, without attending a formal educational institution. This is often seen in fields such as technology, business, and medicine, where individuals may become recognized experts without traditional schooling. Therefore, Johnson could have gained his medical knowledge and expertise through self-study and practical experience, allowing him to benefit mankind greatly despite not attending medical school.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.

This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: There are many people in the park when a woman shoots in public toward them, but no one is killed. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is afraid of the police.', 'She is bad at shooting.', 'She is a photographer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a photographer" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation. A photographer would use a camera to "shoot" pictures in public, not a gun, and therefore no one would be killed. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and makes sense in the context of a park setting.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is the best answer because as a minister, she may have performed marriage ceremonies for couples, but does not necessarily need to be legally married herself. Therefore, she could have legally married three couples without being married herself. This explanation is the most plausible and logical given the circumstances presented.
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself. This scenario would allow her to be legally wed to three men without being divorced, enrolled, or separated from any of them.

Question  69
Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: He had a happy childhood and family, but he hasn't received a birthday present for three years recently. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29" because if he was born on February 29, it means that he only has a birthday once every four years during a leap year. This would explain why he hasn't received a birthday present for three years recently. Thus, this answer provides a logical explanation for why he hasn't received a birthday present in three years.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: To go where he was going, the man had to cross the rivers. He was unable to utilize his inflatable raft because of a notice prohibiting boats and swimming on the bank. He finally succeeded in crossing the river. The only bridge on the river was broken. How didn't the man manage to do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'He jumped half-mile far to across the river.', 'He detoured for a long distance to avoid acrossing the river.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it explains how the man was able to cross the river without using a boat or the broken bridge. Crossing a frozen river would allow him to walk across safely, without the need for a raft or a detour. This also fits with the given information that the man was unable to use his inflatable raft due to the prohibition on boats and swimming, so the frozen river would have provided a convenient solution.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: Bouncing Bob was riding a particularly risky horse when suddenly its bridge came off. As they raced down the road, a screaming Bob lung to the horse's ears for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye, Bob saw a car coming, and realizing the horse was completely out of control, he panicked. Failing his arms about, he accidentally caused the horse to come to an abrupt halt. What could Bouncing Bob have done to make the horse stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is because covering a horse's eyes will disorient and startle the horse, causing it to stop. Horses rely heavily on their vision, so obstructing their ability to see is an effective way to make them stop. All the other options involve physical actions that are not guaranteed to make the horse stop, while covering the horse's eyes interferes with its primary sense and is highly likely to cause it to halt.
Question: A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th." This is the best answer because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making the man's actual age 100 years old. Age is typically measured in years, so despite only celebrating 25 birthdays, his age would still be 100 years old based on the number of days he has lived.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it directly addresses the question by explaining how George escaped the building during the power outage. Since he disabled the electric hoist on his platform, he would not have been able to use it to descend from the eighth floor. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a feasible alternative for George to escape from the building in this situation.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.

Question  70
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Only the woman pays attention on the dancer.', 'The dancer is always dancing in front of the woman.', 'The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer." This is the best answer because it explains the presence of the dancer in the room as a projection of the young woman's future aspirations and dreams. It suggests that the dancer is a symbol of the woman's inner desires and ambitions, which only she can see because it is a manifestation of her own thoughts and hopes for the future.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: A woman travelled to Virginia to look for work. She promised her mother that she would return someday. Her mother then exclaimed, "April is here!" in the dead of winter. What makes this possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Her mother stayed in the home for the whole winter.', 'The weather in Virginia is pretty special.', "The woman's name is April.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's name is April." This is the best answer because it explains how the mother's exclamation of "April is here!" in the dead of winter is possible, as the woman's name being April is the reason for the exclamation. It also connects the woman's name to the unexpected timing of her return mentioned in the story.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Apricot Jam was being made by Morgan. She stirred the apricots in the pot after adding them all. It was then that she realized she needed to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots! How did she calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is an execellent chef.', 'She is good at physicis.', 'She counted the pits of apricots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She counted the pits of apricots." This is the best answer because in order to determine the appropriate amount of lemon juice, Morgan needed to know the number of apricots she had added to the pot. By counting the pits of the apricots, she could easily determine the correct amount of lemon juice to add based on the ratio of 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Since the entire house is described as single-story, it is logical to assume that there are no stairs present. This answer aligns with the given information and makes the most sense in the context of a single-story house.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine would have the capability to intentionally sink a ship without the need for a storm or mechanical issue. This explanation is also supported by the fact that the ship sank in front of onlookers and that there were no unusual circumstances such as too many fish or too many spectators in the harbor. Therefore, the presence of a submarine seems like the most logical explanation for the ship's sudden sinking.
Question: A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.

Question  71
Question: A simple peasant bought a number of camels and is taking them to his farm. As he rides contentedly along he counts them - he counts 29. He was sure he had bought 30 camel, so in alarm he jumps off his camel and counts the camels again. To his delight there are 30. Half an hour later, he counts his camels and once more there are just 29. Confused, he climbs off his camel and counts again. Once more there are 30. Can you explain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it" because when the peasant is riding the camel, he is only able to count the 29 camels walking alongside him. However, when he dismounts and counts them again, he includes the camel he was previously riding, totaling 30. When he gets back on the camel, he forgets to count it, leading to the discrepancy in the count once more. This explanation accounts for the fluctuation in the number of camels the peasant counts.
Question: A lady sits down every two weeks and writes two words on 60 pieces of paper. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her hand writing.', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is: The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks. This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific and recurrent action of writing two words on 60 pieces of paper every two weeks. It also provides a practical reason for why she would do this, as it is a routine task related to paying her employees. The other answer choices do not provide a specific and practical reason for the woman's behavior.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is the best answer because it explains why he cherished being called "Batman" despite his dislike for bats - it's likely a nickname given to him for his exceptional skills or performance in baseball. This would make him proud and happy to be associated with the nickname, despite his personal feelings about bats. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for why he would still cherish the nickname.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he's bankrupt. What happened? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee" because it includes the element of being bankrupt after reaching the hotel, which aligns with the initial scenario. The other options do not fully account for the man being bankrupt upon arrival at the hotel. This answer also introduces a creative and unexpected twist, making it the most interesting and fitting choice.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: A man and his dog are both standing on opposite sides of a river. The guy summons his dog, who quickly crosses the river without getting wet. There were no bridges or boats. What was the dog's secret? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'The river was frozen.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is because if the river was frozen, the dog could easily walk across the ice without getting wet. This explanation fits the scenario where the dog quickly crosses the river without using any bridges or boats.
Question: Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison need time to dissolve.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison was in the ice.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is the best answer because if Juliana drank five drinks with the same poison and did not die, then the poison must have been in something that Maria consumed and Juliana did not. Since they ordered the same drink, the only plausible explanation is that the poison was in the ice that was used in Maria's drink. This is supported by the fact that Juliana drank five of the same drinks without ingesting the poison.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket." This is the best answer because it follows the given conditions - each girl gets an apple, and one apple remains in the basket. This solution does not involve sharing or returning the apple, ensuring that each girl gets an apple and one remains in the basket.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the second door with the lions. The lions that haven't eaten in 5 years would have likely died of starvation. This would make it the safest option among the three doors, as the other options (fire and lava or a 1,000-foot drop into alligators) would likely result in certain death.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother. If the beggar was actually the man's sister, then it would make sense that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery. In the operating room, a doctor came in and looked at the little boy and said I can't operate on him he is my son. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is the best answer because it challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions. The doctor being the mother of the son defies the stereotype that only men can be doctors, showcasing the importance of breaking down societal biases and expectations.

Question  72
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: There are many people in the park when a woman shoots in public toward them, but no one is killed. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is afraid of the police.', 'She is bad at shooting.', 'She is a photographer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a photographer" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation.

This explanation aligns with the given scenario and makes sense in the context of a park setting.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']

This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is the best answer because as a minister, she may have performed marriage ceremonies for couples, but does not necessarily need to be legally married herself. Therefore, she could have legally married three couples without being married herself. This explanation is the most plausible and logical given the circumstances presented.
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself. This scenario would allow her to be legally wed to three men without being divorced, enrolled, or separated from any of them.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.

Question  73
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: There lived a man in a house and every time he went to bed he turned on the light. One night, the man forgot to turn on the light. The next day he read the paper and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because living in a lighthouse means he is responsible for ensuring the light is on to guide ships safely. Forgetting to turn on the light led to a ship crashing, causing the man to feel deep self-blame after reading about the incident in the newspaper.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: A man moved into a new house and decided he was tired after the journey and turned off all the lights and went to bed. The next morning he killed 365 people, he does not sleep walk he slept like a baby. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar before sleep. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house" because living in a lighthouse means he would have turned off the light, not the lights, before going to bed. This would have resulted in a shipwreck and the deaths of 365 people. This answer directly explains how he "killed" 365 people without sleeping walking or any other strange behavior.

Question  74
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: A boy accidentally walked into a 10-foot deep pool, yet he didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pool is too deep.', 'The pool was empty.', 'The pool is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The pool was empty." This is because if the pool was empty, there would be no water for the boy to get wet. It would simply be a hole in the ground, and the boy could walk into it without getting wet. This explanation logically accounts for the boy not getting wet despite walking into a 10-foot deep pool.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: Two chickens were passing by a really hungry tiger. Tiger however, saw them but couldn't reach them. What happened? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tigers usually don't eat chicken in the natural.", 'The tiger was in the zoo.', 'The chickens smell too bad for the hunger tiger to approach.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The tiger was in the zoo." This is the best answer because it explains why the tiger couldn't reach the chickens, as it was likely enclosed in a protected area where it couldn't hunt for food. This scenario is a common occurrence in zoos where tigers are kept safe from potential prey.
Question: A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass is too heavy.', 'There is no wine in the glass.', 'Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no wine in the glass." This is the best answer because if there is no wine in the glass, then there is nothing to spill even if the glass is knocked over. This explanation accounts for the fact that not a single drop of wine leaked despite the glass being swung off the table. Therefore, this is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total.', 'Kobe likes eating with two knives and two forks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total." This answer makes the most sense because the question states that Friday, Jason, and Kobe are going to the restaurant for dinner, indicating that there are three people in the group. Given this information, it makes sense that the waiter would provide three sets of knives and forks for the three individuals dining together. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why three sets of utensils were given to their table.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Even in the harshest of droughts, a man living in New York City would never drink from the Mississippi River. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Water from Mississippi river are not part of his traditional or cultural diet.', "The Mississippi River doesn't flow through New York City.", 'Mississippi river water are toxic.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The Mississippi River doesn't flow through New York City." This is the best answer because it is a geographical fact that the Mississippi River does not pass through or near New York City. Therefore, it would be highly unlikely for a man living in New York City to drink from the Mississippi River, especially during a drought, as it would require a significant effort to travel to the river. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and reasonable explanation for why the man would not drink from the Mississippi River.

Question  75
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: A man moved into a new house and decided he was tired after the journey and turned off all the lights and went to bed. The next morning he killed 365 people, he does not sleep walk he slept like a baby. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar before sleep. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house" because living in a lighthouse means he would have turned off the light, not the lights, before going to bed. This would have resulted in a shipwreck and the deaths of 365 people. This answer directly explains how he "killed" 365 people without sleeping walking or any other strange behavior.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.

Answer Choices: ['What time is it?', "What's the square root of 16?", 'What is the result of 5317 by 9321.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "What time is it?" because the answer will change throughout the day, depending on the time. Different people in different locations will provide different answers, and all of them could be correct. Additionally, time is a constantly changing and subjective measurement, making it the perfect question to receive completely different yet correct answers all day long.
Question: Imagine you are in a room, with no doors, windows, or anything. How do you get out? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario presented is not a real-life situation - it's just a thought experiment. There is no actual room to escape from, so the only solution is to stop imagining the scenario. This answer acknowledges the hypothetical nature of the question and provides a clear and logical way to "escape" from the thought experiment.
Question: A store has on sale a computer and word processor small enough to fit in your pocket. It can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write in all languages. A delete device will correct any error. No electricity is required to operate it. The price? Only a few cents! How can the store make a profit by selling it so cheap? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser." This is because the description matches that of a pencil, which can add (write), multiply (repeated writing), subtract (erase), and divide (separate words or numbers), and can write in all languages. The "delete device" refers to the eraser. The store can make a profit by selling it so cheap because the cost of producing a pencil is low, allowing for a high profit margin even with a low sale price.
Question: I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am oxygen.', 'I am sound.', 'I am sunshine.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I am oxygen" because it is a vital element necessary for all living organisms, making it essential to all. Oxygen also plays a role in the corrosion of iron and steel, breaking down walls and towers. Furthermore, its uncontrolled presence can be both desirable for sustaining life and feared in situations such as fire or uncontrolled chemical reactions. Therefore, oxygen fits all the criteria mentioned in the riddle.
Question: I departed my campsite and traveled 3 miles to the south. I then made an eastward turn and traveled 3 miles. After 3 miles of heading north, I turned around and saw a bear eating inside my tent! The bear was what color? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['White.\n', 'Black.', 'Brown.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "White." This is because the only way for the traveler to end up back at his campsite after the described journey is if he had started at one of the Earth's poles. At either of these locations, traveling 3 miles south, then 3 miles east, then 3 miles north would land the traveler back at their original position. Therefore, the bear in the tent must have been a polar bear, which is white in color.

Answer Choices: ['You have to be a teacher.', 'You have to prepate for the whole year.', 'You have to ask teacher for the asnwer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "You have to be a teacher." This is because as a teacher, you would have access to the exam questions and answers before the students, giving you the advantage of knowing the answers sooner than everyone else in the room. This is the only option that directly addresses having an unfair advantage in the exam session.
Question: Sam's father couldn't stop his kid from playing video games. To prohibit Sam from playing video games all the time, the father got a hammer and fixed the problem. Now he can play video games, but Sam cannot. What exactly did the father do?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The dad built a shelf out of Sam's reach and put the video game console up there. The dad can still reach it to play but Sam cannot.", "The dad took the hammer and used it to break Sam's glasses.", "The dad took the hammer and used the hammer's head to lock Sam's feet.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The dad built a shelf out of Sam's reach and put the video game console up there. The dad can still reach it to play but Sam cannot." because it directly addresses the problem of Sam playing video games all the time. By placing the video game console out of Sam's reach, the father prevents him from playing excessively without having to take any extreme actions. This solution allows the father to still have access to the console while also addressing the issue at hand.
Question: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.", 'There was a one-week long holidays.', 'He fiies straightly for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday" because it is a clever and humorous play on words. It is physically impossible to take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday without manipulating time or having a plane with a unique name like "Tuesday." This answer provides a creative and lighthearted explanation for the impossible scenario.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that penguins and their eggs are not available in the Arctic, therefore not part of the traditional or cultural diet of the natives. This explanation aligns with the question's emphasis on the natives of the Arctic, ensuring that it specifically addresses why they would not eat a penguin's egg.
Question: Each and every day, a man gets up early to work out. He always spends a few hours running about his apartments. He surprises himself by discovering that, after a month of hard training, his left leg has acquired much more muscle than his right. How is that feasible since the man is normal and healthy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than inside leg.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'He may have a subtle bias or preference for using his right leg more than his left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than the inside leg." This is the best answer because when running in a circular clockwise direction, the outer leg (the left leg in this case) will cover a greater distance than the inner leg due to the arc of the circle. This discrepancy in distance covered by each leg could lead to the left leg gaining more muscle mass than the right. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why the left leg acquired more muscle after a month of hard training.
Question: There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person already at the south side of the river.', 'They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." because it is the only plausible explanation given the constraints of the situation. Since the riddle states that only one person can fit on the boat, and there is no mention of the person being able to swim or another boat being available, the only logical conclusion is that there was already someone on the south side of the river. Therefore, this answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible solution to the riddle.
Question: Three people are stuck inside a dark cave. The first fears the complete darkness, the second fears bats, and the third fears getting lost. They don't have any flashlights, lanterns or any kind of light source, and their cell phones have no signal so they can't use them as a light source either. How do they get out of the cave? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.", 'They run over around the whole cave and find the way out.', 'They try to run away from the bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the problem of darkness without any light sources. If it's daytime outside the cave, there will be natural light, which allows them to navigate and find their way out without being hindered by their fears. This solution also does not involve any unnecessary or dangerous actions, making it the safest and most practical option.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because the statement is factually accurate and directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. Therefore, this answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.
Question: How was it possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is because the question is asking how it was possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday. The explanation is that the cowboy's horse is named Wednesday, so when he arrives in town on Friday, stays for Saturday and Sunday, and leaves on Wednesday, it appears as though he stayed for two days, when in reality he stayed for five days.
Question: Assume you're in a room with no doors, windows, or anything else. How do you escape? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario provided is impossible and does not represent a real situation. Therefore, the only way to escape is to stop imagining the scenario and focus on real solutions to real problems. There is no practical way to escape a room with no doors or windows.
Question:  A hiker arrives near a lake. He sees a sign where it is written "No swimming allowed.", but the duck jumps into the water. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because ducks can't read.", "Because ducks won't polluted water.", 'Because ducks are tiny to be detected.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because ducks can't read." simply because ducks are not capable of understanding written signs or regulations. The other options do not provide a logical explanation as to why the duck would ignore the sign. Ducks being unable to read is the most straightforward and reasonable explanation for the duck's behavior.
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food," because if the rope is not tied to anything, it would not restrict the horse's movement, allowing it to reach the food 15 meters away. This is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the horse was able to reach its food despite being tethered to a 5-meter long rope.
Question: In a grocery store, a man fills a shopping basket. He walks out of the store without paying, and no one stops him or calls the cops. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and without anyone stopping him. It also aligns with a plausible scenario in a grocery store setting.
Question: A man gives a woman a $10 bill and pays her $3 for a rope. To get change, the woman enters the grocery store right next door. When she comes back, she gives the man $7. Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me, the store clerk says as the customer leaves. The lady hands the cashier a decent bill. How much has she lost in total? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven dollars plus the rope.', 'Thirteen dollars.', 'Seven dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Seven dollars plus the rope" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $10 bill from the man. She then used $3 of that counterfeit bill to pay for the rope, leaving her with $7 in change. When she later exchanged the counterfeit bill at the grocery store for a decent bill, she gave the man back $7, essentially losing the $7 in change she received from the counterfeit bill. So, in total, she lost the $7 in change plus the $3 for the rope, which equals $10.

Question  77
Question: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the deceased could have a brother who is a beggar. Despite the wording of the question creating confusion, the simple explanation is that the beggar is actually a sister to the deceased, not a brother, resolving the apparent contradiction in the question.
Question: Despite being in June, David's birthday is never in the summer. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where the seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, June in Australia is actually in the winter season, not summer. This means that David's birthday, despite being in June, does not fall in the summer season.
Question: Two teams were playing soccer against each other. One player from Team One scored a hat trick (triple goal). Their teammates were very happy. But when he scored the fourth goal, their teammates scolded him instead. How could this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His teammates is envy about him.', 'The player scored in their own goal.', 'He should focus more on defense.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The player scored in their own goal." This is because scoring in their own goal would cause their teammates to scold them, as it directly benefits the opposing team. Scoring a hat trick for the other team would certainly lead to their teammates being upset with the player.
Question: Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee." This is the best answer because it explains the situation in a logical and plausible way. It accounts for the man's actions of pushing the vehicle and his realization of being bankrupt upon arriving at the hotel. It also provides a scenario where the man's financial situation is directly relevant to his predicament, making it the most fitting explanation.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: Why can't a woman, who is now living in Canada, not be buried in the USA? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because she didn't have a visa.", 'Because she is still alive.', 'Because the price is high and unaffordable.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because she is still alive." This is the best answer because the question is about a woman who is living in Canada, not about someone who has passed away. Therefore, the reason she cannot be buried in the USA is because she is still alive, not because of visa status or financial reasons.
Question: There are two bodies on the floor. They are surrounded by water and broken glass. How did they die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because the presence of water and broken glass suggests a fishbowl was involved, and the bodies being goldfish explains the two bodies on the floor. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario described, making them less likely explanations for the situation.
Question: Despite being in December, David's birthday is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia." This is because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December falls in the summer instead of winter. Therefore, David's birthday is never in the winter because he lives in a location where December is a summer month.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the security and succeeded in the end.', 'At that time, he was just walking down the street. He stolen from others previously.', 'The people whom he had stolen is kind and rich.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: Stranger: Is your dog biting? 
Farmer: No. 
The dog suddenly attacks the stranger on the leg. Nonetheless, the farmer was speaking the truth! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', "It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog." This is because the farmer never claimed that the dog attacking the stranger was his own. The question asked if the farmer's dog was biting, and his response was simply "No." The attack could have been carried out by another dog, making the farmer's statement technically truthful. Therefore, the best answer is that it was not the farmer's dog responsible for the attack.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This is the best answer because it provides a rational explanation for the seemingly contradictory events described in the scenario. It also aligns with the facts given and resolves the apparent inconsistency in the story.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.
Question: Every two weeks a woman sits down and writes two words on 60 sheets of paper. Why does she do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her hand writing.', 'The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks.', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman owns her own business with 60 employees. Every week she signs her name on their paychecks." This is the best answer because it directly explains the specific action of writing two words on 60 sheets of paper every two weeks - signing her employees' paychecks. It also accounts for the regular bi-weekly nature of the task and the specific quantity of paper. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a specific and logical explanation for the woman's behavior.
Question: There was a man who everybody called Batman he knew nothing about bats and thought they were gross. He still loved it when people called him Batman! How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." because it suggests that the man might have earned the nickname "Batman" due to his exceptional skills or achievements in baseball. This would explain why he loved being called Batman, despite his dislike for bats, as it would be associated with something positive and admirable. None of the other answer choices provide a clear and logical explanation for his enjoyment of the nickname.

Question  78
Question: When a man leaves for a business trip one morning, he discovers that he left some paperwork at his office. Sir, don't get on the plane, the night watchman commands as he stops him as he runs into his office to retrieve it. Last night, I had a dream that the plane would crash and everyone would perish. He honors his word, and the man decides not to go. As expected, the plane crashes, killing everyone on board. The following morning, the man rewards the watchman with $1,000 for saving his life before dismissing him. Why did he let go of the watchman who kept him alive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The boss thought one thousand dollars is too much for a reward.', 'The watchman was fired for not warning the man in advance.', 'The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the watchman was fired for sleeping on the job. Although he had a premonition about the plane crash, he was not fulfilling his duties by falling asleep on the job. This breach of responsibility likely led to the man's decision to dismiss him, despite the potentially life-saving warning.
Question: In 1250, a woman is 30 years old. In 1240, the same woman is 20 years old. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The genes in person is unnormal as others.', 'This woman wanted to stay younger so she revised his birthday.', 'The years are being counted in B.C', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The years are being counted in B.C." In 1250 BC, the woman was 30 years old, and in 1240 BC, she was 20 years old. In this case, the years are being counted backward, as BC (Before Christ) is a countdown from the supposed year of the birth of Jesus. Therefore, the woman's age being 30 in 1250 BC and 20 in 1240 BC is possible because the years are being counted in reverse.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A man sets out to plant a flower at sunrise and his friend asks him to return by the next moonrise. But when he returns, the flower he planted has already wither and fall. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His friends waters the flower very carefully.', 'His flower grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months." This is the best answer because in Alaska, the phenomenon of the polar day and night can cause the sun to be visible for up to six months, followed by a six-month period of darkness. Therefore, the flower would wither and fall before the next moonrise due to the extended period of sunlight or darkness.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional car that is neither a red or a blue.', 'Mrs.Smith has one car that is blue and red at the same time.', 'Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is the best answer because it satisfies the condition that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue - he only has two cars, so one must be red and one must be blue. This explanation adheres to the information provided in the question and is the most logical conclusion.
Question: There are 3 apples available for 2 fathers and 2 boys to consume. They each receive a single apple. How is it a mathematical possibility? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sons shared the same apple.', 'One father gave his apple to his son.', 'They are one son, one father and one grandfather.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one son, one father and one grandfather." This is the best answer because it allows for each person to receive an apple without anyone having to share or give up their own. It accounts for the 2 fathers, 2 boys, and the 3 apples by including a grandfather in the scenario, creating a mathematical possibility for each person to receive a single apple.
Question: A girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and parties for 3 days and came back on the 4th of July. How did she do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['July 7th is holiday.', 'The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it provides a clever solution to the riddle. The wording of the question is tricky, making it seem like the girl went over and came back on the same day. However, the answer reveals that she actually went over on the 4th of July and came back on a boat named the July 4, cleverly turning the question itself into a play on words.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the second door with the lions. The lions that haven't eaten in 5 years would have likely died of starvation. This would make it the safest option among the three doors, as the other options (fire and lava or a 1,000-foot drop into alligators) would likely result in certain death.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: A new explorer got lost while travelling. She decided to walk 3 miles to the south and made an eastward turn, and ran 3 miles. Suddenly she realized it was the wrong way then she decided to walk 3 miles to the north. Amazingly, she went back to the point of departure. Where is she? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Equator.\n', 'South Pole.', 'North Pole.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the North Pole. When the explorer walked 3 miles south and then made an eastward turn, she effectively started walking in circles around the North Pole. By walking 3 miles to the north, she completed the circle and returned to her point of departure. This scenario is only possible near the North Pole, where walking in a small circle will bring a person back to the same spot. Therefore, the best answer is the North Pole.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is because the magician likely filled the glass with a clear, colorless substance that looks like water, such as a clear gel or silicone, which would not spill when the glass is dropped. This explanation accounts for the appearance of a full glass of water without any spillage when dropped from a height of six feet.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: Ten pears hung high, ten men passed past, Each taking a fruit and leaving nine hanging there. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other men can't reach the pear.", "Other men didn't see the pear.", 'EACH is the name of one of the men.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is because the word "Each" is indicating that the name of one of the men is actually "Each", and not making a statement about the action being performed. This clever wordplay allows for the riddle to be solved with a simple explanation.
Question: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The intense weather conditions flood the marina.', 'The boat is towed by police.', "The station wasn't fixed in the marina", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The station wasn't fixed in the marina" because if the station was not properly secured or fixed in the marina, it could easily come loose and allow the boat to drift away. This scenario would explain how the boat ended up in the middle of the ocean a couple of hours later. The other answer choices do not adequately explain how the boat could have ended up in the ocean from being parked in the marina.
Question: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The intense weather conditions flood the marina.', 'The boat is towed by police.', "The station wasn't fixed in the marina", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is that the station wasn't fixed in the marina. If the station was not properly secured or fixed in the marina, it could easily come loose and allow the boat to drift away. This scenario would explain how the boat ended up in the middle of the ocean a couple of hours later. The other answer choices do not adequately explain how the boat could have ended up in the ocean from being parked in the marina.

Question  79
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: A killer has been sentenced to death. He must select one of three rooms. The first is filled with blazing fires, the second with assassins with loaded firearms, and the third with lions that haven't fed in three years. Which room is the most secure for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the killer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Only the woman pays attention on the dancer.', 'The dancer is always dancing in front of the woman.', 'The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer." This is the best answer because it explains the presence of the dancer in the room as a projection of the young woman's future aspirations and dreams. It suggests that the dancer is a symbol of the woman's inner desires and ambitions, which only she can see because it is a manifestation of her own thoughts and hopes for the future.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.

Question  80
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: A man was staring out a sixth-floor window when he decided to jump. He did not perish or get any injuries. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt.', 'He used the collision between his body and walls to slow down.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it." because it provides a logical explanation for why the man did not perish or get injured after jumping from the sixth floor. If he was outside the window to wash it, then he would have been attached to a safety harness or rope, which would have prevented him from falling to the ground. This explanation is the most plausible and realistic, given the circumstances described.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A boat on the lake included four men. All four men on the boat sink to the bottom of the lake when it flips over. However, not a single man gets wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because they were all married and not single.', 'The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because the question is a play on words - while it initially appears to refer to getting wet with water, it actually refers to being single versus being married. This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: Here on Earth, a certain big animal prospers and lives happily. One day, a mystery disease that solely affects this unique species annihilates each and every one of these writers. They are all gone; there are none remaining everywhere on earth. They start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the animal is the Mule. This is because all Mules are born sterile, so you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse. This means that even if all the Mules were wiped out by a mystery disease, they could start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later through the crossbreeding of donkeys and horses. This unique reproductive characteristic of Mules allows for their reemergence despite being wiped out.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.', 'Two girls filled the from together.', 'One mother is too old to apply for new IDs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother" because it explains that there are three individuals - a grandmother, her daughter (the mother), and her granddaughter (the daughter). This aligns with the given scenario of two mothers and two daughters, as well as the agent only giving out three forms, as each person is represented. The other answer choices do not accurately address the relationship dynamics of the individuals in the scenario.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Mark was in the kitchen cooking everyday and yet he wasn't getting paid. He had to buy all the ingredients and everything himself as well. why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was a chef and a dad at the same time. when he was home, nobody was paying him to cook', 'He wanted to research new creations.', 'He was so bad at cooking so the boss was unwilling to pay him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was a chef and a dad at the same time. when he was home, nobody was paying him to cook" because it provides a valid reason for why Mark was not getting paid for cooking. It explains that Mark's cooking was done at home as part of his role as a dad, not as part of his job as a chef where he would typically be paid for his cooking skills. This answer aligns with the scenario presented and provides a logical explanation for why Mark was not getting paid while cooking in the kitchen.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added.

By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the possibility of a stone growing and producing fruit, by explaining that the "stone" was actually a seed. The explanation about the seed of a cherry being called a stone provides a logical and scientific explanation for the phenomenon, making it the most plausible and accurate option.

This is the best answer because it is a practical and logical solution to stop Mark from coming to the office, and it aligns with the boss's responsibility to manage the workplace. The other options are extreme and inappropriate actions that would not be a suitable response to a bad employee.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The coach of the team is the boy's mother." This is the best answer because it explains how the coach can refer to the boy as "my son" even though the man at the baseball game is the boy's father. It reveals that the coach is the boy's mother, allowing for both statements to be true.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.

The other options do not fit the evidence as well as the poison in the envelope.

However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it explains how the beggar's brother could have died without the man who died having a brother.

This answer provides a logical and feasible explanation for the scenario presented in the question.

Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to stick to, so even though it was thoroughly saturated by the rain, not a single hair was wet. This scenario explains how the cat could be completely soaked but not have any wet hair.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery.

Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is the best answer because it challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions. The doctor being the mother of the son defies the stereotype that only men can be doctors, showcasing the importance of breaking down societal biases and expectations.
Question: A man sets out to plant a flower at sunrise and his friend asks him to return by the next moonrise. But when he returns, the flower he planted has already wither and fall. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His friends waters the flower very carefully.', 'His flower grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months." This is the best answer because in Alaska, the phenomenon of the polar day and night can cause the sun to be visible for up to six months, followed by a six-month period of darkness. Therefore, the flower would wither and fall before the next moonrise due to the extended period of sunlight or darkness.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']

By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Since the entire house is described as single-story, it is logical to assume that there are no stairs present. This answer aligns with the given information and makes the most sense in the context of a single-story house.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: A bus journeying through the desert had six women aboard. Suddenly, the bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere and all six women have to walk under the scorching sun. Yet, not a single woman gets sunburnt! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There came a big cloud which covered the sun for several minutes.', "A woman's skin is thick enough to withstand the sun's rays", 'Because they were all married and not single.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a creative and unexpected twist to the question, as the typical assumption would be related to the physical environment or the characteristics of the women. By stating that they didn't get sunburnt because they were all married, it adds a humorous and unexpected element to the answer, making it the best choice.
Question: A man took several shots heavily and even fell down from the hit, but he still survived. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man has a strong ability to heal himself.', 'The man is strong enough.', 'They were whiskey shots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were whiskey shots." because the phrase "took several shots heavily" typically refers to consuming alcoholic beverages, not getting physically shot. Therefore, the man survived because he consumed a large amount of whiskey and not because of any extraordinary physical ability.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation described in the question. It suggests that the deceased person's sibling was actually a sister who worked as a police officer, rather than a brother as initially assumed. This explanation fits the criteria of the question and solves the apparent contradiction presented.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: A woman travelled to Virginia to look for work. She promised her mother that she would return someday. Her mother then exclaimed, "April is here!" in the dead of winter. What makes this possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Her mother stayed in the home for the whole winter.', 'The weather in Virginia is pretty special.', "The woman's name is April.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's name is April." This is the best answer because it explains how the mother's exclamation of "April is here!" in the dead of winter is possible, as the woman's name being April is the reason for the exclamation. It also connects the woman's name to the unexpected timing of her return mentioned in the story.
Question: A man and his dog are both standing on opposite sides of a river. The guy summons his dog, who quickly crosses the river without getting wet. There were no bridges or boats. What was the dog's secret? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'The river was frozen.', 'None of above.']

Question: A girl was hanging around in the countryside. She slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'The well is dry.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry." This is because if the well is dry, there is no water in it for the girl to get wet. It explains why she didn't get wet despite falling into a 60-foot well. None of the other answer choices address the lack of water in the well.
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket." This is the best answer because it follows the given conditions - each girl gets an apple, and one apple remains in the basket. This solution does not involve sharing or returning the apple, ensuring that each girl gets an apple and one remains in the basket.
Question: Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is the best answer because if Juliana drank five drinks with the same poison and did not die, then the poison must have been in something that Maria consumed and Juliana did not. Since they ordered the same drink, the only plausible explanation is that the poison was in the ice that was used in Maria's drink. This is supported by the fact that Juliana drank five of the same drinks without ingesting the poison.

Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment."

By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.
Question: There were two bosses and two employees in a meeting room discussing different tasks. At the end of the meeting, there three tasks for all the people in that meeting. How is that possible Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss.", 'One boss gaves his fish to his employee.', 'Two employees shared the same task.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss." This explanation allows for two bosses and two employees in the meeting. One of the employees is also a boss, which can account for the three tasks assigned at the end of the meeting. This scenario logically explains how the situation is possible.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: Bouncing Bob was riding a particularly risky horse when suddenly its bridge came off. As they raced down the road, a screaming Bob lung to the horse's ears for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye, Bob saw a car coming, and realizing the horse was completely out of control, he panicked. Failing his arms about, he accidentally caused the horse to come to an abrupt halt. What could Bouncing Bob have done to make the horse stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.", "Bob accidentally pulled on the horse's tail. Horses are sensitive to their tail being pulled and would naturally stop when it happens.", "Bob accidentally slapped the horse's flank. The surprise made the horse stop suddenly out of fear.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see, he will automatically stop." This is because covering a horse's eyes will disorient and startle the horse, causing it to stop. Horses rely heavily on their vision, so obstructing their ability to see is an effective way to make them stop. All the other options involve physical actions that are not guaranteed to make the horse stop, while covering the horse's eyes interferes with its primary sense and is highly likely to cause it to halt.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Although they were born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were not born in the same year.', 'One student ran away from home at a young age.', 'One student had a bad academic grades and broken up with his parents.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were not born in the same year." This is because it is the most logical explanation for two students who are otherwise unrelated to share the same birthday. It is entirely conceivable that two unrelated students could be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, especially in a large school with many students. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for this situation is that the students were born on the same day of the same month but in different years.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was on a motorcycle.', 'The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because if the man was driving a car, having only two wheels on the pavement would constitute a violation and the policeman would most likely have given him a ticket. However, since the policeman did not give him a ticket, it can be inferred that the man was on a motorcycle, where having only two wheels on the pavement would not be a violation.
Question: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Matthew is a deep-sea diver.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Matthew was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Matthew is a deep-sea diver" because his behavior of making plans to visit a deep spot and plunging into profound depths indicates that he has experience and comfort with deep-sea diving. His lack of injury or harm may be attributed to his training, experience, and knowledge of safe diving practices. This explanation aligns with his behavior and the lack of harm despite his risky behavior.
Question: There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him', "The man was tired and doesn't want to anything anymore.", 'The man thought the first day of the job should be a hoilday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was blind and they had to explicitly tell him what to do not to show him" because it explains why the employee wasn't doing anything his boss showed him to do. Despite claiming to be willing to do anything, the employee likely needed specific instructions and verbal guidance due to his visual impairment. This would result in difficulty following visual demonstrations, leading to his boss's annoyance on the first day of the job.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.

Question  83
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'This man is bald.', 'This man walk upside down to avoid rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald" because if Samuel is bald, then he wouldn't have any hair on his head to get wet in the rain. This explains how his clothes got soaked but not a single hair on his head got wet. This is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: How many birth days does the average person have? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.', 'They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.', 'It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime." This is because a birth day refers to the specific day on which a person was born, and a person can only have one actual day of birth in their lifetime. While people may celebrate their birthdays annually, this does not change the fact that they were only born on one specific day. Therefore, the answer accurately reflects the concept of a birth day. None of the other options accurately address the concept of a birth day.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: A man was looking through a 6th floor window,  thought for a minute then jumped,  but did not die or get hurt at all. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt.', 'He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.', 'He used the collison between his body and walls to slow down.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it" because it presents a logical explanation for how the man was able to jump from the 6th floor window without getting hurt. It suggests that he was outside the window performing a task, which would allow him to land safely. This explanation aligns with the given details and provides a plausible reason for the man's survival.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: How can you leave a room with two legs and return with six legs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bring another man back with you.', 'Bring a chair back with you.', "You're walking back upside down.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Bring a chair back with you." This is because if you leave a room with two legs (your own) and return with six legs, it implies that you have brought something with four legs (such as a chair) back with you. This answer aligns with the logic of the question and provides a feasible explanation for the scenario.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass is too heavy.', 'There is no wine in the glass.', 'Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no wine in the glass." This is the best answer because if there is no wine in the glass, then there is nothing to spill even if the glass is knocked over. This explanation accounts for the fact that not a single drop of wine leaked despite the glass being swung off the table. Therefore, this is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.

Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.

Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.
Question: A knock on the door is heard by the woman while she is seated in her hotel room. When she opens the door, she is greeted by a stranger. I'm sorry, I made a mistake; I thought this was my room, he apologizes. He then exits the elevator and walks down the hall. The woman returns to her room and makes a security call. What gave the woman cause to be so wary of the man? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman knows this man on the newspaper.', 'If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.\n', 'The woman thought the man is rude.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first." This is the best answer because it shows that the man's behavior was suspicious and not consistent with someone trying to enter their own room. Instead of trying to enter with his key, he knocked on the door, which raised the woman's suspicion and prompted her to make a security call.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His hair is dyed.\n', 'This man is bald.', 'This man walk upside down to avoid rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "This man is bald" because if Samuel is bald, then he wouldn't have any hair on his head to get wet in the rain. This explains how his clothes got soaked but not a single hair on his head got wet. This is the most logical and plausible explanation for the situation described.
Question: Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee." This is the best answer because it explains the situation in a logical and plausible way. It accounts for the man's actions of pushing the vehicle and his realization of being bankrupt upon arriving at the hotel. It also provides a scenario where the man's financial situation is directly relevant to his predicament, making it the most fitting explanation.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the security and succeeded in the end.', 'At that time, he was just walking down the street. He stolen from others previously.', 'The people whom he had stolen is kind and rich.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At that time, he was just walking down the street. He had stolen from others previously." This choice explains that the thief had already committed the thefts before walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from. This suggests that the thief was not caught because he had already committed the thefts and was not caught in the act at that particular moment. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the thief was not caught despite walking past the security guards and the people he had stolen from.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: A girl finds a door, opens it, after sometime her body is found dead how is that possible since nobody shot her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the girl's body was found dead without being shot. Opening the door of an airplane in mid-flight would result in depressurization, leading to a rapid drop in altitude and causing her body to be found dead. This scenario aligns with the given information and provides a logical explanation for the girl's death.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The beggar was the man's sister." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the deceased could have a brother who is a beggar. Despite the wording of the question creating confusion, the simple explanation is that the beggar is actually a sister to the deceased, not a brother, resolving the apparent contradiction in the question.
Question: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.

Question  85
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires" because reducing the air pressure in the tires would lower the overall height of the semi, allowing it to free itself from the overpass. This solution does not require any extreme measures like lifting or overturning the truck and is a practical and effective way to resolve the issue.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.

Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself.

Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.

Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: There are many people in the park when a woman shoots in public toward them, but no one is killed. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is afraid of the police.', 'She is bad at shooting.', 'She is a photographer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a photographer" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation. A photographer would use a camera to "shoot" pictures in public, not a gun, and therefore no one would be killed. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and makes sense in the context of a park setting.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is the best answer because as a minister, she may have performed marriage ceremonies for couples, but does not necessarily need to be legally married herself. Therefore, she could have legally married three couples without being married herself. This explanation is the most plausible and logical given the circumstances presented.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother" because this scenario is possible if the sisters all have the same brother, meaning there is only one brother in the family. This would make a total of seven children (6 daughters and 1 brother), along with the parents, totaling nine family members. This explanation fits within the constraints of the given information and is the most logical solution.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The first coach has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man" because it is the only explanation that aligns with the given information. If the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers, it means they have the same father and mother. Therefore, if the coaches of the first and fifth champions share the same parents, but are also not brothers, it means they are the same person who fathered the coaches of both championship teams. This scenario fits all the given criteria and is the most logical explanation.

Question  87
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how.

Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: To go where he was going, the man had to cross the rivers. He was unable to utilize his inflatable raft because of a notice prohibiting boats and swimming on the bank. He finally succeeded in crossing the river. The only bridge on the river was broken. How didn't the man manage to do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'He jumped half-mile far to across the river.', 'He detoured for a long distance to avoid acrossing the river.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it explains how the man was able to cross the river without using a boat or the broken bridge. Crossing a frozen river would allow him to walk across safely, without the need for a raft or a detour. This also fits with the given information that the man was unable to use his inflatable raft due to the prohibition on boats and swimming, so the frozen river would have provided a convenient solution.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it directly addresses the question by explaining how George escaped the building during the power outage. Since he disabled the electric hoist on his platform, he would not have been able to use it to descend from the eighth floor. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a feasible alternative for George to escape from the building in this situation.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.

Best Answer: The best answer is "She had already put sugar in it and when she tasted the new tea it was already sweet." This is the best answer because the woman had already put sugar in her original tea, and when she tasted the new tea, she realized that it was already sweet, indicating that it was the same tea. This method is a clear and direct way for the woman to determine that it was the same tea, making it the best answer.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.

Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.

Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.

Answer Choices: ['Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he juggled the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because by juggling the gold, Johnny was able to have only one or two pieces on the bridge at any given time, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeded the limit of 80 kilograms. Therefore, he was able to safely cross the bridge with all the gold.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word.

Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.

Answer Choices: ['The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house." This is the best answer because a single-story house typically does not have stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, it is not applicable to talk about the color of the stairs in a single-story house. This answer logically aligns with the given scenario.
Question: The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors? Choose the best answer choice.

Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the best answer because the killer will be safe in a room with dead lions, as they pose no threat. The other options, such as blazing fires and assassins with loaded firearms, present immediate dangers to the killer. Therefore, the third room is the most secure choice for the killer.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.

Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Morgan is the name of a hurricane" because it provides a rational explanation for why people witnessing Morgan's death may not feel sad. The lack of emotional reaction is due to the fact that Morgan's death is a natural phenomenon related to the hurricane, rather than a personal tragedy. This explanation aligns with the context of the situation and provides a logical reason for the lack of sadness.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Johnson is a famous doctors in the world and benefit mankind greatly. However, he never been to a medical school. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'Johnson is a "doctors" in the academic sense ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnson is a 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it is possible for someone to gain knowledge and expertise in a certain field through self-study, experience, and practical application, without attending a formal educational institution. This is often seen in fields such as technology, business, and medicine, where individuals may become recognized experts without traditional schooling. Therefore, Johnson could have gained his medical knowledge and expertise through self-study and practical experience, allowing him to benefit mankind greatly despite not attending medical school.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: A boy had just gotten out of the shower and was getting ready for his prom, shaved and with cologne, and there would be an after-party. And his mom and dad said to be home for the next sunrise and he was home for the next sunrise but with a full-grown beard. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He went crazy with friends in that unnormal party.', 'His beard grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months." This is the best answer because in some parts of Alaska, the sun does not set for several months during the summer due to the phenomenon of the midnight sun. Therefore, the boy being home for the next sunrise with a full-grown beard would make sense if he lived in a place where sunrises only occur every six months. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the boy's sudden beard growth.

Question  91
Question: Andy is placed in a cell with no windows and a dirt floor. He can't reach the window because it's too high. A shovel is the sole object in the cell. He won't be able to find food or water, and he only has two days to flee or perish. Andy is unable to construct a tunnel since it will take him considerably longer than two days. How will Andy get out of the cell? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Andy has to use the shovel to break the wall of the cell and escape from it.', 'Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.', 'Andy should use the shovel to reflect sunlight from the window in to seek help.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that Andy should use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell. This is the best answer because it provides a practical and feasible solution for Andy to reach the window and escape within the limited time frame of two days. Breaking the wall of the cell would be noisy and risky, while reflecting sunlight would not guarantee help in time. Creating a dirt pile allows Andy to utilize the resources he has in the cell to escape safely and effectively.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: In the midst of a plumbing shutdown, Jack was stuck on the tenth floor of an apartment building fixing a leaky pipe. The elevator was out of order due to the plumbing issue. How did he manage to get out of the building before the plumbing was fixed? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Jack get to the roof and escape.', 'Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator.\n', 'Jack needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator." This is the best answer because it directly addresses how Jack managed to exit the building despite the plumbing shutdown and the non-functional elevator. It highlights the simple and practical solution of using the stairs to leave the building, demonstrating logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: Thomas was caught stealing 27 times in one year, yet he was never arrested. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All person stolen are rich and kindess.', 'Thomas was a baseball player and was stealing bases.', 'Stealing is not a serious crime.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Thomas was a baseball player and was stealing bases." This is the best answer because stealing bases is a common occurrence in the sport of baseball, and it is not considered a crime in that context. Therefore, Thomas was able to steal 27 times in one year without being arrested because it was part of his job as a baseball player. This explanation aligns with the given information and makes sense in the context of the situation.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A cat was walking pass a security guard when the guard told him not to enter the area since it was restricted. However, the cat passed the security guard without any sense of obedience.Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The cat thought it won't bring danger", "Since cats can't understand humans' language", 'The cat thought it was hard to detect itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since cats can't understand humans' language". This is because cats do not have the ability to understand spoken language, so the cat would not have comprehended the security guard's warning. The cat's lack of obedience can be attributed to its inability to comprehend human communication, rather than a deliberate act of disobedience or calculation of potential danger.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper." This explains why she frequently goes to high locations and jumps without getting hurt. As a sky jumper, she has the necessary training, equipment, and experience to safely perform these jumps. This behavior is not a sign of suicidal intent, but rather a recreational activity that she finds therapeutic.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: A girl finds a door, opens it, after sometime her body is found dead how is that possible since nobody shot her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the girl's body was found dead without being shot. Opening the door of an airplane in mid-flight would result in depressurization, leading to a rapid drop in altitude and causing her body to be found dead. This scenario aligns with the given information and provides a logical explanation for the girl's death.
Question: A guy goes to a football stadium for each time their team has a match, and yet he is left with a lot of money at the end of the year. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is the craziest fan of that football team.', 'He is the coach of the football team.', 'He got his money from the football players to appreciate his support.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is the coach of the football team." This is the best answer because as the coach, he would not have to pay for tickets to enter the stadium for each match, and he may also receive a salary or compensation for his role. This would explain why he has a lot of money left at the end of the year despite attending all the matches.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." This is the best answer because it directly explains the cause of the man's death immediately after his suit was torn. In space, a ripped suit would expose the astronaut to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid decompression and ultimately death within minutes. This explanation directly connects the torn suit to the man's sudden demise.
Question: Two teams were playing soccer against each other. One player from Team One scored a hat trick (triple goal). Their teammates were very happy. But when he scored the fourth goal, their teammates scolded him instead. How could this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His teammates is envy about him.', 'The player scored in their own goal.', 'He should focus more on defense.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The player scored in their own goal." This is because scoring in their own goal would cause their teammates to scold them, as it directly benefits the opposing team. Scoring a hat trick for the other team would certainly lead to their teammates being upset with the player.
Question: James lives in a sky scraper with 100 floors. his house is broken into by killers, so he runs towards the window and jumps being scared, but he doesn't die. how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He landed safely on the body of the killers.', 'he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor', 'He was strong enough to avoid any hurt due to the help of doing exercise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "he was in the first floor, so nothing happened to him by jumping one floor." This is the best answer because if James was on the first floor, jumping one floor down would not cause any harm or injury. Since he was only on the first floor, there was not enough distance for him to sustain any injuries from the fall.
Question: A man was swimming in a sea, when he had a small injury and he lost only a small amount of blood, a minute later, he died in a painful way Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never get hurt before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'When he started bleeding, a shark noticed and ate him.', "The wound won't heal in the sea. He was so afraid of dying and scared himself.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he started bleeding, a shark noticed and ate him." This is the best answer because a small injury and loss of blood in the sea would attract sharks, especially if the injured person is floundering and in distress. The shark's attack would have caused a painful death, and this explanation is the most plausible given the circumstances.
Question: Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how Brad survived the fall - he didn't actually jump outside the building, but rather inside, possibly into a small space or onto a lower level. This interpretation aligns with the fact that Brad was overcome with depression and simply wanted to escape the situation, without necessarily intending to harm himself.

Answer Choices: ['Because they were all married and not single.', 'The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because the question is a play on words - while it initially appears to refer to getting wet with water, it actually refers to being single versus being married. This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: Why is Christmas Day so chilly? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December" because Christmas Day falls on December 25th, which is typically a winter month in the northern hemisphere. The colder temperatures are due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, causing less sunlight and shorter days during this time of year. Therefore, Christmas Day is generally chilly because it occurs during the winter season in December.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question:  A woman went to Virginia to get a job. She promised her mother she would come back and visit sometime. Then, in the middle of winter, her mother shouted, "April is here!". How is this possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman's name is April.", 'Her mother stayed in the home for the whole winter.', 'The weather in Virginia is pretty special.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's name is April." This is the best answer because the statement from the mother, "April is here," can be interpreted as the mother referring to her daughter, whose name is April, coming back to visit, rather than the month of April arriving. This explanation makes the most sense given the context of the scenario.
Question: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, he could use the sound of the bullet hitting the hat to determine the direction in which he needed to aim and shoot. This allowed him to accurately shoot the bullet into the hat while blindfolded and without the use of his vision. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for how the shooter could achieve this feat.
Question: A girl fell into a 60-foot well after slipping, but she was unwet. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry" because if the well had no water in it, then the girl wouldn't have gotten wet despite falling 60 feet. It is physically impossible to fall into water and not get wet, so the only logical explanation is that the well is dry. This explanation accounts for the situation and is the most plausible among the given answer choices.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: How could a guy go outdoors in the torrential rain without getting a single hair on his head wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is bald.', '\nThe man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.', 'The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bald." This is because if a guy is bald, he does not have any hair on his head to get wet in the torrential rain. Therefore, he can go outdoors in the rain without getting a single hair on his head wet. This explanation logically and directly addresses the question by providing a specific reason for how the guy could stay dry in the rain.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: Two women and two doctors walk into an ice cream parlor. They each order an ice cream cone. When their ice cream come, there is only 1 strawberry,1 chocolate and 1 vanilla. How come they didn't complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the women was a doctor.', "The ice creams are big enough for more than one people, so the shop think they won't complain.", "One of them is kind and didn't complain even though the shop forgets hers.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the women was a doctor." This is because being a doctor implies a level of understanding and patience, and the presence of a doctor in the group may have influenced the others to not complain about the ice cream flavors. It is also a subtle reference to the stereotype of doctors being more understanding and less likely to cause a scene in public places.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Wednesday,Tom and Joe went to a restaurant and ate dinner. When they were done they paid and left. Tom and Joe didn't pay. Who did? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'The restaurant is too expensive.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day." This is the best answer because it clearly identifies the third person in the group as the one who paid, distinguishing them from the day of the week. This solution accounts for the fact that Tom and Joe didn't pay, leaving Wednesday as the only remaining person who could have paid for the meal.
Question: Wednesday,Tom and Joe went to a restaurant and ate dinner. When they were done they paid and left. Tom and Joe didn't pay. Who did? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'The restaurant is too expensive.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day." This is the best answer because it clearly identifies the third person in the group as the one who paid, distinguishing them from the day of the week. This solution accounts for the fact that Tom and Joe didn't pay, leaving Wednesday as the only remaining person who could have paid for the meal.

Question  93
Question: An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This is the best answer because it provides a rational explanation for the seemingly contradictory events described in the scenario. It also aligns with the facts given and resolves the apparent inconsistency in the story.
Question: Two men are using a ladder but both are face-to-face and can't pass each other. How's that physically possible ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two man are using the ladder alternatively.', 'The ladder is set horizontally and two people are hanging from it one going from left to right and the other one from right to left', 'With the help of optical illusions,both you and your friend can not pass each other.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ladder is set horizontally and two people are hanging from it one going from left to right and the other one from right to left". This is the best answer because it physically allows two people to be on the ladder and facing each other without being able to pass each other. This situation is physically possible as one person can be hanging from the ladder on one side and the other person hanging from the other side, preventing them from passing each other.
Question: A girl finds a door, opens it, after sometime her body is found dead how is that possible since nobody shot her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the girl's body was found dead without being shot. Opening the door of an airplane in mid-flight would result in depressurization, leading to a rapid drop in altitude and causing her body to be found dead. This scenario aligns with the given information and provides a logical explanation for the girl's death.
Question: A knock on the door is heard by the woman while she is seated in her hotel room. When she opens the door, she is greeted by a stranger. I'm sorry, I made a mistake; I thought this was my room, he apologizes. He then exits the elevator and walks down the hall. The woman returns to her room and makes a security call. What gave the woman cause to be so wary of the man? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman knows this man on the newspaper.', 'If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.\n', 'The woman thought the man is rude.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first." This is the best answer because it shows that the man's behavior was suspicious and not consistent with someone trying to enter their own room. Instead of trying to enter with his key, he knocked on the door, which raised the woman's suspicion and prompted her to make a security call.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: There are two bodies on the floor. They are surrounded by water and broken glass. How did they die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because the presence of water and broken glass suggests a fishbowl was involved, and the bodies being goldfish explains the two bodies on the floor. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario described, making them less likely explanations for the situation.
Question: Sam's dad couldn't keep his son from playing video games. To keep Sam from playing video games all the time, the dad grabbed a hammer and solved the problem. Now he can play video games but Sam cannot. What did the dad do Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The dad took the hammer and used it to break Sam's glasses.", "The dad built a shelf out of Sam's reach and put the video game console up there. The dad can still reach it to play but Sam cannot.", "The dad took the hammer and used the hammer's head to lock Sam's feet.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The dad built a shelf out of Sam's reach and put the video game console up there. The dad can still reach it to play but Sam cannot." because it directly addresses the problem by physically preventing Sam from accessing the video game console. This solution doesn't involve any harmful or abusive actions towards Sam, and it allows the dad to still have access to the console if he wants to play. This option promotes a healthy approach to managing screen time for Sam.
Question: Four men were in a boat on the lake. The boat turns over, and all four men sink to the bottom of the lake, yet not a single man got wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', 'Because they were all married and not single.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and clear explanation for why none of the men got wet despite the boat turning over and sinking. The answer is a play on words, as it interprets "not a single man got wet" as meaning "not a single man who was unmarried got wet." This answer cleverly solves the riddle and makes the most sense in the context of the question.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.
Question: 10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There were enough food in each plate even if it was stolen.', 'They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.', 'There were no food on the table.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing." This is the best answer because if the table was rounded, each person could easily reach every other person's plate, allowing for an equal distribution of food stealing. Additionally, if everyone was participating in the same behavior, then it is possible for all of them to have eaten the same amount, resulting in nobody being hungry.
Question: Stranger: Is your dog biting? 
Farmer: No. 
The dog suddenly attacks the stranger on the leg. Nonetheless, the farmer was speaking the truth! How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', "It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog." This is because the farmer never claimed that the dog attacking the stranger was his own. The question asked if the farmer's dog was biting, and his response was simply "No." The attack could have been carried out by another dog, making the farmer's statement technically truthful. Therefore, the best answer is that it was not the farmer's dog responsible for the attack.
Question: There are five apples in a basket. You distribute them among the five girls, giving each one an apple while leaving one apple in the basket. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket" because it is the most logical solution to ensure all five girls receive an apple. By giving the fifth girl her apple in the basket, all the apples are distributed and each girl receives one, while also leaving one apple in the basket. This resolves the initial problem without requiring any unlikely scenarios such as sharing or returning the apple.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is the best answer because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it got completely soaked, its hairless skin would still remain dry. This explanation accounts for the cat's lack of wetness despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: One evening, Joe and Sally were relaxing in their family room. Sally, Joe's wife, was reading while he was watching television. The moment the electricity went out, Joe made the decision to retire to bed, but Sally continued to read. Sally carried on reading without using any artificial lighting. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'Sally is smart that she pretended to reading the book.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille" because it explains how Sally was able to continue reading without using artificial lighting after the electricity went out. This answer provides a logical and plausible explanation for Sally's ability to continue reading in the dark.
Question: Joe and Sally were sitting in their family room one night. While Joe was watching T.V, his wife Sally was reading. All of a sudden the power went out and Joe decided to go to bed, but Sally kept on reading. With no use of artificial light, Sally kept on reading. How? Choose the best answer choice.

Question  94
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The stone that was buried in the ground symbolizes an idea or a concept. By burying the idea and nurturing it with care and effort, it grew and blossomed into a fruitful outcome or achievement.', 'You buried a stone in the ground, and as time passed, a tree grew above it. The fruit produced by the tree is unrelated to the stone itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the possibility of a stone growing and producing fruit, by explaining that the "stone" was actually a seed. The explanation about the seed of a cherry being called a stone provides a logical and scientific explanation for the phenomenon, making it the most plausible and accurate option.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.

Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.

Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water."

A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.

How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'The ground is close to a lake.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because certain fruits, like cherries, have a pit or stone inside that is actually the seed. When planted, the seed can sprout leaves and fruit, as it is a viable seed. The other answer choices do not provide a logical or feasible explanation for a stone sprouting leaves and fruit.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how.

Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair.

Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.

This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm.

Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights.

Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years.

Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other.

This is the best answer because it effectively separates Tom and his sister without allowing them to touch each other. By standing on each side of the newspaper which has been slid under the door, they are physically unable to touch each other and are forced to stand separately. This solution effectively stops their fighting and punishment is fulfilled.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.

Question  96
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, he could use the sound of the bullet hitting the hat to determine the direction in which he needed to aim and shoot. This allowed him to accurately shoot the bullet into the hat while blindfolded and without the use of his vision. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for how the shooter could achieve this feat.
Question: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it directly addresses the question by explaining how George escaped the building during the power outage. Since he disabled the electric hoist on his platform, he would not have been able to use it to descend from the eighth floor. Additionally, the other answer choices do not provide a feasible alternative for George to escape from the building in this situation.
Question: A boat on the lake included four men. All four men on the boat sink to the bottom of the lake when it flips over. However, not a single man gets wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because they were all married and not single.', 'The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because the question is a play on words - while it initially appears to refer to getting wet with water, it actually refers to being single versus being married. This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.
How did he die? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', "The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without the need for weapons or suicide. It also fits the clue of the sealed envelope on the desk in front of him. The other options do not fit the evidence as well as the poison in the envelope.
Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.", 'People were camping under the tree.', 'The wind blows heavily.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves" because it provides a logical explanation for why the gust of wind did not cause any leaves to fall. In winter, many trees shed their leaves, so it is natural that there were no leaves to fall when the wind blew. This explanation aligns with the observation that none of the people sitting under the tree were hit by any falling leaves.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It was not the farmer's dog.", 'The dog just wanted to show its closeness.', 'The dog never bit the farmer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was not the farmer's dog" because the farmer's statement was still true - his own dog did not bite. It is possible that the dog that bit the stranger was a different dog, not belonging to the farmer. This explanation is the most logical and makes the most sense in explaining why the farmer's statement was truthful despite the stranger being bitten by a dog.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.

Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "He positioned himself" because it is the most logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By positioning himself and using the water paddle as a makeshift support, he would have been able to hang himself from the ceiling. This method fits the scenario described and is the most feasible solution to the mystery.

Question  97
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: How could a guy go outdoors in the torrential rain without getting a single hair on his head wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He is bald.', '\nThe man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.', 'The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bald." This is because if a guy is bald, he does not have any hair on his head to get wet in the torrential rain. Therefore, he can go outdoors in the rain without getting a single hair on his head wet. This explanation logically and directly addresses the question by providing a specific reason for how the guy could stay dry in the rain.
Question: I departed my campsite and traveled 3 miles to the south. I then made an eastward turn and traveled 3 miles. After 3 miles of heading north, I turned around and saw a bear eating inside my tent! The bear was what color? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['White.\n', 'Black.', 'Brown.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "White." This is because the only way for the traveler to end up back at his campsite after the described journey is if he had started at one of the Earth's poles. At either of these locations, traveling 3 miles south, then 3 miles east, then 3 miles north would land the traveler back at their original position. Therefore, the bear in the tent must have been a polar bear, which is white in color.
Question: A murderer is condemned to death. He has to choose between three rooms. The first is full of raging fires, the second is full of assassins with loaded guns, and the third is full of lions that haven't eaten in 3 years. Which room is safest for him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', 'The second door, the murderer is a master in avoiding the bullet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead." This is the safest choice because lions that haven't eaten in three years would not be alive to pose any danger. Therefore, the murderer would be safest in the room with the dead lions.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.

How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are no stairs in a single story house.', 'It should be pink as the whole house is in pink.', 'The stairs is uncolored as people always step on that.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no stairs in a single-story house" because a single-story house typically does not have any stairs. Single-story houses are designed without multiple floors, so it is not common for them to have stairs. This answer makes the most sense in the context of the given scenario and is the most accurate choice.
Question: Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'He positioned himself.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could have hung himself without a table or chair. By standing on a block of ice, he would have had a platform from which to hang himself, and as the ice melted, it would have disappeared, leaving no evidence behind. This method also explains the absence of a table or chair.
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.

The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Imagine you are in a room, with no doors, windows, or anything. How do you get out? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Stop imagining.', 'Jump out of the roof.', 'Break the Wall.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Stop imagining." because the scenario presented is not a real-life situation - it's just a thought experiment. There is no actual room to escape from, so the only solution is to stop imagining the scenario. This answer acknowledges the hypothetical nature of the question and provides a clear and logical way to "escape" from the thought experiment.
Question: A thirty-story skyscraper caught fire one day. Nothing happened to a man who leapt out a window. Nothing was beneath him. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was first floor.', 'He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." because if the man leapt out of a window from the first floor of a thirty-story skyscraper, he would not have been injured by the fall since it was not a significant distance from the ground. This explanation aligns with the scenario described in the question, making it the most logical and accurate solution.
Question: Two women and two doctors walk into an ice cream parlor. They each order an ice cream cone. When their ice cream come, there is only 1 strawberry,1 chocolate and 1 vanilla. How come they didn't complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the women was a doctor.', "The ice creams are big enough for more than one people, so the shop think they won't complain.", "One of them is kind and didn't complain even though the shop forgets hers.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the women was a doctor." This is because being a doctor implies a level of understanding and patience, and the presence of a doctor in the group may have influenced the others to not complain about the ice cream flavors. It is also a subtle reference to the stereotype of doctors being more understanding and less likely to cause a scene in public places.
Question: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, he could use the sound of the bullet hitting the hat to determine the direction in which he needed to aim and shoot. This allowed him to accurately shoot the bullet into the hat while blindfolded and without the use of his vision. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for how the shooter could achieve this feat.
Question: A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.', 'The basement is uncolored as the basement is only used for storing stuffs.', 'It should be red as the whole house is in red.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor." This is the best answer because a one-story house does not typically have a basement. Since the house is built on a single floor, there is no space underneath for a basement. Therefore, the concept of the color of the basement does not apply to this type of house.
Question: Wednesday,Tom and Joe went to a restaurant and ate dinner. When they were done they paid and left. Tom and Joe didn't pay. Who did? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'The restaurant is too expensive.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day." This is the best answer because it clearly identifies the third person in the group as the one who paid, distinguishing them from the day of the week. This solution accounts for the fact that Tom and Joe didn't pay, leaving Wednesday as the only remaining person who could have paid for the meal.
Question: A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.', 'It should be red as the whole house is in red.', 'The basement is uncolored as the basement is only used for storing stuffs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor." because the description specifically states that the house is one-story, meaning there are no additional floors below ground level. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that there is no basement in this type of house. The other answer choices make assumptions or provide irrelevant information, making them less appropriate answers.
Question: Nolan is outside a shop. She can not read the signs but she knows she needs to go in to make a purchase. What store is she at? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Eye glasses store.', 'Fruit store.', 'Bakery.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Eye glasses store" because Nolan cannot read the signs, indicating that the store likely sells something related to her vision. It would make sense for her to need to go into an eye glasses store to make a purchase related to her vision, such as getting new glasses or contacts. The other options, like a fruit store or bakery, do not fit the context of Nolan needing to make a purchase related to her vision. Therefore, the most logical choice is the eye glasses store.
Question: Nolan is outside a shop. She can not read the signs but she knows she needs to go in to make a purchase. What store is she at? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Eye glasses store.', 'Fruit store.', 'Bakery.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Eye glasses store" because the scenario describes Nolan not being able to read the signs, indicating that the store likely sells something related to her vision. It would make sense for her to need to go into an eye glasses store to make a purchase related to her vision, such as getting new glasses or contacts. The other options, like a fruit store or bakery, do not fit the context of Nolan needing to make a purchase related to her vision. Therefore, the most logical choice is the eye glasses store.

Question  98
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: There were a group of people including artists, doctors, and nurses all in a flight. The flight crashed before getting to the destination but no man was injured nor died. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The flight crashed in a remote and uninhabited area with no witnesses.', 'All the passengers were skilled in crash survival.', 'All the people on the flight were female.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All the people on the flight were female." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and reasonable explanation for why no one was injured or died in the crash. If all the people on the flight were female, then it would not be possible for "no man" to be injured or die in the crash. Therefore, this answer effectively solves the riddle provided.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires" because reducing the air pressure in the tires would lower the overall height of the semi, allowing it to free itself from the overpass. This solution does not require any extreme measures like lifting or overturning the truck and is a practical and effective way to resolve the issue.

Question  99
Question: Mark was a bad employee and his boss was annoyed by him. His boss wanted to do something to stop him from coming to the office. He picked up the phone and fixed the problem. Now, Mark can't come to the office and he's fired.  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore', "The boss used his phone to hit Mark's head heavily.", 'The boss called the police to tell them how worse the Mark was.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore." This is the best answer because it is a practical and logical solution to stop Mark from coming to the office, and it aligns with the boss's responsibility to manage the workplace. The other options are extreme and inappropriate actions that would not be a suitable response to a bad employee.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: He had a happy childhood and family, but he hasn't received a birthday present for three years recently. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29" because if he was born on February 29, it means that he only has a birthday once every four years during a leap year. This would explain why he hasn't received a birthday present for three years recently. Thus, this answer provides a logical explanation for why he hasn't received a birthday present in three years.
Question: A horse travels a certain distance each day. Strangely enough, two of its legs travel 30 miles each day and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles. It would seem that two of the horse's legs must be one mile ahead of the other two legs, but of course, this can't be true, since the horse is normal. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'The measurements are taken from different reference points.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs." This is the best answer because when a horse operates a mill, it moves in a circular motion, causing the outer legs to cover more distance than the inner legs. This explains why two legs travel 30 miles and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles each day. Therefore, this logically explains the seemingly impossible scenario.
Question: A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a "no left turn" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was walking.', 'There was no police in that cop car.', 'He tried to get away from the police.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was walking" because the question mentions that the person was a "bus driver," so it's a deliberate misdirection. The scenario described does not apply to a bus driver driving a bus but rather to a person walking. This explanation best fits with the given scenario of the bus driver not breaking any traffic laws.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: In a remote village, a wise traveler decides to check out local dental implants. There are only two dentists in the village, each with a clinic. Glance at the first clinic and see that the dentist's own teeth are badly planted and his salon is poorly maintained. The second salon is tidy, the dentist's teeth are well planted and his attire is spotless. Why smart travelers choose dental implants in the first clinic? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentisit who had given his rival the better implants.", 'The traveler chose the first dentist because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the dentist was so busy.', 'The traveler went to the first dentist because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each dentist must have planted the other's teath. The traveler picked the dentist who had given his rival the better implants." This is the best answer because it suggests that the reason why the first dentist's teeth were poorly planted is because he had been busy giving the second dentist a better set of implants. It explains why the first dentist's salon was untidy and his own teeth poorly placed, leading the smart traveler to choose the first dentist for his own dental implants.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because his nickname "Lightning" likely comes from his speed and agility on the track, rather than any connection to actual lightning or meteorology. This explains why he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning," despite his fear of storms and lack of interest in meteorology. It also aligns with his nickname being a source of pride and recognition for his athletic abilities.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.', 'Two girls filled the from together.', 'One mother is too old to apply for new IDs.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother" because it explains that there are three individuals - a grandmother, her daughter (the mother), and her granddaughter (the daughter). This aligns with the given scenario of two mothers and two daughters, as well as the agent only giving out three forms, as each person is represented. The other answer choices do not accurately address the relationship dynamics of the individuals in the scenario.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.
Question: A man was in an airplane, when one of the engines failed and he threw himself out of the plane, however, he didn't use his parashoot. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed', 'He stretched himself in the air to decrease the speed.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt from sky.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The plane was still on the ground when the engine failed." This is the best answer because if the man threw himself out of the plane without using a parachute, it means the plane had not yet taken off, and therefore was still on the ground when the engine failed. This explains how he could survive without using a parachute.
Question: Without breaking any rules, a man managed to enter a ladies-only club. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man was a security guard at the club.', 'He succeeded in getting away from the security.', 'The club wanted to make fun of the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was a security guard at the club." This is the best answer because being a security guard at the club gives him legitimate access to the premises without breaking any rules. As a security guard, he would have been authorized to enter the ladies-only club as part of his job responsibilities. Therefore, he did not need to sneak in or deceive anyone to gain entry.
Question: They were eight students, taking an exam with nobody else inside the room. when the time was up, they were only 7 taken tests. How's that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the students was a examiner.', 'Two students had the same answer, so they just handed in one paper.', 'One student handed in a blank paper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One of the students was an examiner." This is the best answer because if one of the students was an examiner, then there were actually only 7 students taking the exam. The examiner would not need to hand in a test paper, which explains why there were only 7 tests turned in.
Question: Although they were born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were not born in the same year.', 'One student ran away from home at a young age.', 'One student had a bad academic grades and broken up with his parents.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were not born in the same year." This is because it is the most logical explanation for two students who are otherwise unrelated to share the same birthday. It is entirely conceivable that two unrelated students could be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, especially in a large school with many students. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for this situation is that the students were born on the same day of the same month but in different years.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach" because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. This means that even though there are only six participants (five players and one coach), each player still has their own coach. Therefore, the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team is explained by the fact that the players share the same coach. This is a logical and practical explanation for the situation described.

Question  100
Question: It turns out that Sandy was being truthful when she said she had seen an forest devoid of leaves. How is it even doable?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sandy saw the forest on a map.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy snow.', 'The forest is experiencing a heavy rain.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sandy saw the forest on a map" because it provides a logical and feasible explanation for her claim of seeing a forest devoid of leaves. It is possible that the forest she saw on the map was in a different season or had experienced a natural phenomenon, such as a forest fire, which would explain the lack of leaves. This explanation aligns with Sandy being truthful about her observation.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['John wanted to be a photographer.', 'John wants to be a video game designer  and his parent are addicted to vedio gams.', "The parents known John was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: A woman shoots publicly at people at a National Park. The park is full of people, but no one gets killed. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman was a photographer.', 'People are enjoying themselves in the park.', 'The woman wanted to cause chaos.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer." This is because if the woman was a photographer, she may have been shooting with a camera, not a gun. Therefore, she could have been taking pictures of people in the National Park without causing harm. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the woman could shoot publicly at people in a National Park without anyone getting killed.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th." This is the best answer because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making the man's actual age 100 years old. Age is typically measured in years, so despite only celebrating 25 birthdays, his age would still be 100 years old based on the number of days he has lived.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.

Question  101
Question: Johnson is a famous doctors in the world and benefit mankind greatly. However, he never been to a medical school. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'Johnson is a "doctors" in the academic sense ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnson is a 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it is possible for someone to gain knowledge and expertise in a certain field through self-study, experience, and practical application, without attending a formal educational institution. This is often seen in fields such as technology, business, and medicine, where individuals may become recognized experts without traditional schooling. Therefore, Johnson could have gained his medical knowledge and expertise through self-study and practical experience, allowing him to benefit mankind greatly despite not attending medical school.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it presents a logical reason for why Monica, the person, was not allowed to collect the winning trophy despite her victory - she is actually the name of the horse that won the race. This explanation accounts for Monica's victory and why she was not allowed to collect the trophy, making it the most plausible answer.
Question: The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The crew could understand the extreme whether.', 'The crew finally got their monthly salary.', 'The crew were not cruising in the sea.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The crew were not cruising in the sea." because if the sea was really stormy and it was a cold night, it would be unlikely for the crew to be comfortable and warm while out at sea. It is possible that the crew were stationed at a port or on land, where they could seek shelter from the storm and have access to heating and other amenities to stay comfortable. Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
Question: One day, a thirty-story building was on fire. A man jumped out a window and nothing happened to him. Nothing was under him. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was strong enough to avoid hurt.', 'He rubs against the outer wall to create a cushion.', 'He was first floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was first floor." This is because the man jumped from the ground level of the building, so there was nothing under him to cause harm. The other answer choices do not accurately explain the situation, as there is no evidence to suggest that he was strong enough to avoid hurt or that he rubbed against the outer wall to create a cushion. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he jumped from the first floor and landed safely on the ground.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Monica could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'Monica was really sweaty and smells.', 'Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Monica is the name of the horse that won the race." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why Monica, the competitor, was not permitted to accept the winning trophy despite winning the race. It suggests that there may have been a mix-up or misunderstanding, where the organizers mistook Monica for the name of the horse instead of the competitor.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Ocean is too cold that it freezes totally.', 'The whether is too hot that vaporates all water.', 'The ocean is on a map.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ocean is on a map." This is the best answer because Sandy could have seen a representation or depiction of an ocean on a map, which would not actually contain water. This explanation aligns with the idea that Sandy was being honest about seeing an "ocean without water."
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse." This is because lighthouse keepers are required to keep the light on at all times to guide ships and prevent them from crashing into the shore. Therefore, his boss didn't blame him for wasting electricity because it was part of his job to keep the light on in the lighthouse.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man died from a severe allergic reaction to the envelope's paper.", 'The man got cut mistakenly by the envelope.', 'The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The envelope glue was poisoned, and when the man licked the envelope to seal it, he died." This is the best answer because it explains how the man died without any weapons present, and it fits the scenario where the man is found alone in a closed office with a sealed envelope as the only clue. This answer provides a plausible explanation for the man's sudden death.
Question: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is the best answer because it is historically accurate - the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th president. This is why despite sharing the same parents, they were not related. This explanation makes the most logical sense in the context of American presidential history.
Question: There are many people in the park when a woman shoots in public toward them, but no one is killed. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is afraid of the police.', 'She is bad at shooting.', 'She is a photographer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a photographer" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for the situation. A photographer would use a camera to "shoot" pictures in public, not a gun, and therefore no one would be killed. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and makes sense in the context of a park setting.
Question: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is because as a minister, she could perform marriage ceremonies and legally marry multiple couples without being personally married to any of them herself. This scenario would allow her to be legally wed to three men without being divorced, enrolled, or separated from any of them.
Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman is not a good person.', 'His husband is not a good husband.', 'She is a minister.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She is a minister." This is the best answer because as a minister, she may have performed marriage ceremonies for couples, but does not necessarily need to be legally married herself. Therefore, she could have legally married three couples without being married herself. This explanation is the most plausible and logical given the circumstances presented.
Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.

Question  102
Question: A woman opened a door, streamed, and then was found dead a few minutes later. No gunshot were heard in the area. What happened to her? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Upon opening the door, the woman was stunned by the sunlight outside.', 'Upon opening the door, the woman was startled by her own reflection in a mirror. ', 'She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was on an airplane and opened the door while the plane was in flight, falling to her death." This is the best answer because it explains the lack of gunshot sounds and the suddenness of her death after opening the door. Additionally, it is a plausible explanation for the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: There is an ambulance that is carrying a patient that is severely injured, however, when they get stuck in traffic, the ambulance is not trying to squeeze in the free spots to get to the hospital faster. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nNo one wants to give way to the ambulance , so they give up. ', "The driver is cautious and don't want to break the law.", 'The patient in the ambulance is dead.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the patient in the ambulance is dead. If the ambulance is not trying to squeeze through traffic to get to the hospital faster, it is likely because there is no urgency to reach the hospital. This would only be the case if the patient is no longer in need of immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the ambulance's behavior is that the patient has unfortunately passed away.
Question: When the radio abruptly stops playing, Fred is still listening to it. Fred is alone, and no one plays with the radio. After a brief pause, the radio starts up again. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel." This is because when a car enters a tunnel, the radio signal can be disrupted or lost, causing the radio to abruptly stop playing and then start up again once the car exits the tunnel. This scenario explains why Fred is still listening to the radio and why it starts up again after a brief pause. None of the other answer choices provide a reasonable explanation for the radio's behavior.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: A simple peasant bought a number of camels and is taking them to his farm. As he rides contentedly along he counts them - he counts 29. He was sure he had bought 30 camel, so in alarm he jumps off his camel and counts the camels again. To his delight there are 30. Half an hour later, he counts his camels and once more there are just 29. Confused, he climbs off his camel and counts again. Once more there are 30. Can you explain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it" because when the peasant is riding the camel, he is only able to count the 29 camels walking alongside him. However, when he dismounts and counts them again, he includes the camel he was previously riding, totaling 30. When he gets back on the camel, he forgets to count it, leading to the discrepancy in the count once more. This explanation accounts for the fluctuation in the number of camels the peasant counts.
Question: The same restaurant was in two friends calendars for the same hour, day, and month. They did not, however, cross paths. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person focuses on the delicious food so much.', 'One person is richer than the other.', "They ddin't go in the same year.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They ddin't go in the same year." This is because even though the restaurant reservation was on the same hour, day, and month, it is possible that they were in different years. For example, one friend may have made the reservation for November 15th, 2021, while the other friend made the reservation for November 15th, 2022. This would explain how they did not cross paths despite having the same reservation.
Question: A man took several shots heavily and even fell down from the hit, but he still survived. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man has a strong ability to heal himself.', 'The man is strong enough.', 'They were whiskey shots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were whiskey shots." because the phrase "took several shots heavily" typically refers to consuming alcoholic beverages, not getting physically shot. Therefore, the man survived because he consumed a large amount of whiskey and not because of any extraordinary physical ability.
Question: A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His phone still has signal at Italy.', 'He put all visa materials in his phone.', 'Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man could celebrate his birthday in Italy with only his phone. It suggests that the man went to a restaurant with the name "Italy" and celebrated his birthday there, without actually traveling to the country itself. This makes sense in the context of the question and is a plausible scenario.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two car wheels was large enough to support the him.', 'The policeman was superised by his driving skill.', 'He was on a motorcycle.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was on a motorcycle." This is the best answer because a person on a motorcycle can take a bend with just two wheels on the pavement, as it is a common maneuver for motorcycles. The other answer choices do not provide a valid explanation for the situation described.
Question: A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'It was day time.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." because in the scenario described, it is implied that it is daytime. The driver would have been able to see the guy strolling down the rural way, even without any lights on. The visibility factor in the daytime would make it easy for the driver to notice the person on the road. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and not due to listening, paying attention, or any other reason.
Question: A man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he's bankrupt. What happened? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee" because it includes the element of being bankrupt after reaching the hotel, which aligns with the initial scenario. The other options do not fully account for the man being bankrupt upon arrival at the hotel. This answer also introduces a creative and unexpected twist, making it the most interesting and fitting choice.
Question: David's birthday is in December, but it is never in the winter. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His family will hold a huge celebration for him.', 'He alwasy gets cold in winter.', 'He lives in Australia.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Australia" because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, where December is actually in the summer season. Therefore, even though David's birthday is in December, it is not in the winter because of the geographic location of Australia.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This answer makes the most sense because it explains how the woman could have "shot" her husband, held him underwater (in a darkroom's chemical bath), and then "hung" him (to dry as a photograph) without actually harming him. This explanation aligns with the actions described in the question and does not involve any illegal or impossible scenarios.
Question: A man sets out to plant a flower at sunrise and his friend asks him to return by the next moonrise. But when he returns, the flower he planted has already wither and fall. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His friends waters the flower very carefully.', 'His flower grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months." This is the best answer because in Alaska, the phenomenon of the polar day and night can cause the sun to be visible for up to six months, followed by a six-month period of darkness. Therefore, the flower would wither and fall before the next moonrise due to the extended period of sunlight or darkness.

Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female" because it is the only option that could explain how one boxer was knocked out without any punches being thrown. In this scenario, it is possible that one of the female boxers fainted or was unable to continue due to exhaustion or other medical reasons, without any physical impact from the other boxer. Therefore, this is the most logical and reasonable explanation for the situation described.
Question: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother" because this scenario is possible if the sisters all have the same brother, meaning there is only one brother in the family. This would make a total of seven children (6 daughters and 1 brother), along with the parents, totaling nine family members. This explanation fits within the constraints of the given information and is the most logical solution.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for how the pilot was able to fly through the ring with his vision obscured. By attaching the ring to the front of his plane, the pilot could use it as a reference point to guide the plane through the ring without needing to see it. This method would allow the pilot to navigate and successfully fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others.
Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway.

Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." Despite the street lights and traffic signals not working and the limousine's headlights being turned off, the scenario implies that it was still light enough for the driver to see the boy. The absence of the moon and the boy not having a flashlight further support the idea that it was during daylight hours. The other options are not supported by the information given in the scenario.
Question: There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Only the woman pays attention on the dancer.', 'The dancer is always dancing in front of the woman.', 'The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer." This is the best answer because it explains the presence of the dancer in the room as a projection of the young woman's future aspirations and dreams. It suggests that the dancer is a symbol of the woman's inner desires and ambitions, which only she can see because it is a manifestation of her own thoughts and hopes for the future.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." This is the best answer because releasing some air from the tires would lower the height of the semi, allowing it to pass out from under the overpass. This solution is practical and feasible given the situation, and it would effectively free the semi from its tight spot without causing damage.
Question: Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One of the boxer was knocked out due to the exhaustion.', 'They only used their heads in the match.', 'Both the boxers were female.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Both the boxers were female." This is the best answer because it directly explains the scenario by suggesting that one of the female boxers was knocked out after six rounds without throwing a punch, as it implies that one of the boxers became pregnant. This aligns with the rules of pure boxing and provides a feasible explanation for the situation without contradicting any of the given conditions. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and appropriate choice.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.

Answer Choices: ['One mother gave her dollars to two girls.', 'Seven dollar is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations: the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which satisfies the conditions of the riddle. This answer makes the most sense and provides a logical explanation for the situation.

Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it explains how the secretary knew the little girl and why she would refer to her as "my daughter." It also fits with the scenario of the bank manager allowing the girl to stay with the secretary during the meeting. This answer resolves the apparent contradiction in the situation.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tim uses his limbs to keep rubbing against the ground to slow down, and he's so strong that he can brake quickly.", "Tim, in a moment of panic, used his mind powers to telekinetically halt the motorcycle's movement, bringing it to a sudden stop", "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop." This is the best answer because hitting the engine kill switch is a realistic and practical action that could have been taken by Tim to make the motorcycle stop. It fits with the scenario described and is a common safety feature on motorcycles. The other answer choices involve unrealistic or fictional elements, making them less plausible.
Question: In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a calendar maker.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist moved into a rare greenhouse.', 'The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed." This is the best answer because it directly relates to the man's habit of lighting the room before bed and his deep self-blame the following day. The consequences of not turning on the light in a lighthouse can be catastrophic, as it can lead to ships crashing. This explanation fits the given scenario and aligns with the man's feelings of guilt and responsibility.
Question: When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." because in an orphanage school, there may not be biological parents to protest on behalf of the children. This would explain why no parents protested the instructor's disciplinary actions.
Question: Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin." This is the best answer because it is the most logical explanation for why the fifth man did not speed up and did not get wet in the rain. It also explains how all five men could reach the same location at the same time. This answer is the most plausible given the circumstances described in the question.
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school" because in an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This situation is unique to an orphanage school and would explain why there were no objections from parents.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is the best answer because it effectively physically separates the two siblings, preventing them from touching each other while still being in close proximity. This method also allows the mother to easily monitor the situation and ensure that the punishment is being followed.

Question  104
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['May 6th is holiday.', 'He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.', 'The boy drank a lot and slept at festival for 5 days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man pointed to some people at random.', 'The name of the man who was asking the question was You', 'The man was angry for his impolite question.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The name of the man who was asking the question was You" because it explains why the man pointed to the person asking the question. The phrase "where is you?" suggests that the person being asked is named "You," so when the man pointed to the person asking the question, it was a literal response to the question. This interpretation makes logical sense of the situation described.
Question: On July 4, a girl traveled to the United States to party for three days before returning on July 4. How did she manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'July 7th is holiday.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it logically explains how the girl was able to party in the United States for three days before returning on July 4. This answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible explanation for the girl's travel plans. None of the other answer choices offer a practical or realistic explanation for how the girl managed to party in the United States for three days before returning on the same date.
Question: A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The pilot got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.", 'The plane was too far away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the man ended up in the next century - by traveling across the new year's midnight. It is a plausible scenario that aligns with the given information and doesn't rely on unlikely events such as the pilot getting lost or the plane being too far away.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: Katie picks up 30 pages of papers every evening and write numbers from 0 to 20 on them. Why does she act this way? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She wants to practice her math.', 'She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them', 'She tries to take full advantage of papers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She has a class with 30 students and every day she distributes small quiz papers and in the evening she grades them" because it directly addresses the specific action of picking up 30 pages and writing numbers on them, which aligns with the task of distributing and grading quiz papers for 30 students. It provides a clear and logical reason for her behavior based on her role as a teacher, making it the most likely explanation.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A guy embarks on a voyage between Mexico and the United States. He makes $300,000 from his trip despite not stopping at any ports or even leaving the stateroom. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a captain though he forgot to carry the passengers.", "He's a smuggler.", 'He got his tip from a rich passenger.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He's a smuggler" because the scenario describes a situation where the guy is making a large sum of money without stopping at any ports or leaving the stateroom, indicating that he is engaging in illegal activities such as smuggling. The other answer choices do not adequately explain how the guy could make $300,000 without leaving the stateroom or stopping at any ports.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $35. Adding the cost of the perfume ($5), the total loss for the woman is $40. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" is the most accurate representation of the woman's loss in this situation.
Question: A man buys a rope from a woman for $3.00 and hands the woman a $10 bill. The woman goes into the grocery store next door to get change. She returns and gives the man $7.00. After the man leaves, the clerk from the store comes and says, "Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me." The woman gives the clerk a good bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven dollars.', 'Seven dollars plus the rope.', 'Thirteen dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Seven dollars plus the rope." The woman initially received $10 for the rope, but ended up giving $7 in change and the rope back to the man. When the counterfeit bill was discovered, she had to give a good bill to the store clerk, resulting in a loss of the counterfeit bill ($10), the $7 in change, and the value of the rope ($3), totaling a loss of $20. Therefore, the woman lost seven dollars plus the value of the rope.

Question  105
Question: A pet shop owner had a parrot with a sign on its cage that said "Parrot repeats everything it hears". Davey bought the parrot and for two weeks he spoke to it and it didn't say a word. He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The parrot was tired.', 'Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The parrot was deaf" because if the parrot couldn't hear anything, it wouldn't be able to repeat what it hears. This explains why the parrot didn't say anything despite Davey speaking to it for two weeks. It also aligns with the shopkeeper's claim that he never lied about the parrot's ability.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: Ten pears hung high, ten men passed past, Each taking a fruit and leaving nine hanging there. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other men can't reach the pear.", "Other men didn't see the pear.", 'EACH is the name of one of the men.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is because the word "Each" is indicating that the name of one of the men is actually "Each", and not making a statement about the action being performed. This clever wordplay allows for the riddle to be solved with a simple explanation.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is carrying three pieces of gold each piece weighing one kilogram. While taking a walk he comes to a bridge that has a sign posted saying the bridge could hold only a maximum of 80 kilograms. John weighs 78 kilograms and the gold weighs three kilograms. Johnny reads the sign and still safely crossed the bridge with all the gold. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he juggled the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because by juggling the gold, Johnny was able to have only one or two pieces on the bridge at any given time, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeded the limit of 80 kilograms. Therefore, he was able to safely cross the bridge with all the gold.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: A town that has been painted black has a black dog standing in the midst of an intersection. Due to a storm-related power outage, none of the street lights are functioning. When a car with two broken headlights approaches the dog, it turns away in time to miss him. How was the dog able to be seen by the driver in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'It was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because even though the town has been painted black and the street lights are not functioning due to a power outage, the scenario mentions nothing about it being night time. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is still daylight, allowing the driver to see the dog in time to avoid hitting it.
Question: A girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and parties for 3 days and came back on the 4th of July. How did she do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['July 7th is holiday.', 'The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it provides a clever solution to the riddle. The wording of the question is tricky, making it seem like the girl went over and came back on the same day. However, the answer reveals that she actually went over on the 4th of July and came back on a boat named the July 4, cleverly turning the question itself into a play on words.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.
Question: A man who lived on the top floor of a twenty story building had to go up and down daily for work, and of course, for food and the other necessities. On most days he could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story, and he would have to walk the rest of the way. When it rained, however, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator.

Answer Choices: ['The poison need time to dissolve.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison was in the ice.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is the best answer because if Juliana drank five drinks with the same poison and did not die, then the poison must have been in something that Maria consumed and Juliana did not. Since they ordered the same drink, the only plausible explanation is that the poison was in the ice that was used in Maria's drink. This is supported by the fact that Juliana drank five of the same drinks without ingesting the poison.
Question: Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop? Choose the best answer choice.

During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse." This is the best answer because it directly fits the description of an animal that has parents but no children and cannot give birth to offspring. Mules are a result of a specific crossbreeding process between a male donkey and a female horse, and as a result, they are unable to reproduce. This aligns with the given characteristics of the animal in the question.

This scenario is a common occurrence in zoos where tigers are kept safe from potential prey.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: Two officers are stationed along a one-way roadway, checking for traffic offenses. They see a taxi driver driving in the wrong direction but do nothing. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There was no people on that street so the violation is permiteed.', "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.", 'The taxi diver tried to get away from the polices.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking." because it provides a logical explanation for why the officers did nothing in response to the taxi driver driving in the wrong direction. If the taxi driver was seen walking instead of driving at the time, then there was no valid reason for the officers to take action as there was no traffic violation. Therefore, this answer provides a clear and sensible explanation for the officers' inaction.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill and gave $15 in change, resulting in a loss of $35. Adding the cost of the perfume ($5), the total loss for the woman is $40. Therefore, "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume" is the most accurate representation of the woman's loss in this situation.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver is good at smelling.', 'It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was daytime" because the question mentions nothing about the time of day, and without the streetlights working the darkness would not have allowed the driver to see the black dog. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime, allowing the driver to see the dog and avoid hitting it.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator." This is the best answer because it explains the specific situation of the man's inability to reach the 20th floor button, and how he was able to overcome this limitation by using his umbrella when it rained to press the button. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride to the 20th floor only when it rained.
Question: Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Fred was driving his car through a tunnel" because when Fred enters a tunnel, the radio signal often gets disrupted due to the lack of reception. This explains why the radio suddenly stopped playing and then resumed a few seconds later when Fred exited the tunnel. This scenario also fits with the fact that nobody was with Fred and nobody touched the radio.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: Even in the harshest of droughts, a man living in New York City would never drink from the Mississippi River. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Water from Mississippi river are not part of his traditional or cultural diet.', "The Mississippi River doesn't flow through New York City.", 'Mississippi river water are toxic.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The Mississippi River doesn't flow through New York City." This is the best answer because it is a geographical fact that the Mississippi River does not pass through or near New York City. Therefore, it would be highly unlikely for a man living in New York City to drink from the Mississippi River, especially during a drought, as it would require a significant effort to travel to the river. Therefore, this answer is the most logical and reasonable explanation for why the man would not drink from the Mississippi River.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." This is the best answer because by hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun, the sharpshooter was able to use his sense of touch to feel the direction in which he was walking. This allowed him to turn around and aim the gun in the right direction to shoot the bullet through his hat. This method of using touch to determine his position and aim accurately is the only logical explanation for how he was able to achieve this feat while blindfolded.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and why no one stopped him. As an employee, he would have a legitimate reason for leaving the store with a full cart and no one would have reason to intervene or call the police. This explanation fits the scenario and is the most logical reason for the man's actions.
Question: A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign "Parrot repeats everything it hears" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Davey was deaf.', 'The parrot was deaf.', 'The parrot was tired.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the parrot was deaf. This is because the sign on the cage stating "Parrot repeats everything it hears" led Davey to believe that the parrot could hear and speak, but in reality, it was unable to hear anything, so it remained silent. This explanation fits the scenario and the information given in the question.
Question: When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.\n", 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter." This is the best answer because it explains that there are three generations of women - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter - which accounts for the two moms and two daughters mentioned in the question. It also explains why only three slices of pizza were consumed, as the grandmother may have only had a small portion, leaving enough for just three slices to be eaten.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total.', 'Kobe likes eating with two knives and two forks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total." This answer makes the most sense because the question states that Friday, Jason, and Kobe are going to the restaurant for dinner, indicating that there are three people in the group. Given this information, it makes sense that the waiter would provide three sets of knives and forks for the three individuals dining together. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why three sets of utensils were given to their table.
Question: Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total.', 'Kobe likes eating with two knives and two forks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
Step by step reasoning for the best answer: The best answer is "Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total." This answer makes the most sense because the question states that Friday, Jason, and Kobe are going to the restaurant for dinner, indicating that there are three people in the group. Given this information, it makes sense that the waiter would provide three sets of knives and forks for the three individuals dining together. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why three sets of utensils were given to their table.

Question  108
Question: A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The river was frozen.', 'The dog jumped half-mile far and get to the man.', 'The dog can dry off in a sudden.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The river was frozen." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for how the dog could cross the river without getting wet or using a bridge or boat. If the river was frozen, the dog could simply walk across the frozen surface to reach the man. This option aligns with the criteria given in the question and is the most logical solution.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.", 'The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The dead person is a criminal.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now." This is the best answer because it provides a plausible explanation for the man's actions without breaking any laws. As a boxer, he may have unintentionally caused the other person's death during the match, and therefore no one stopped him or called the police because it was an accident in the context of a sport.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'His life is not worth living.', 'The man is not healthy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is because February 29 only occurs in a leap year, which happens every 4 years. So, if Mrs. Adams's son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday, it means he was born on February 29 in a leap year, making his actual birthday occur only every 4 years.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29.\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29." This is the best answer because February 29 only occurs during a leap year, meaning that the son's birthday only happens every four years. This would explain why Mrs. Adams' son turns 16 today but will only be 20 on his next birthday, as he is effectively aging at a slower rate due to the rare occurrence of his birthday.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine" because it is the only logical explanation for a ship to suddenly sink without any visible cause. A submarine can submerge underwater without any external signs and could have caused the sinking of the ship. The other options - too many fish or spectators - do not provide a feasible explanation for the sudden sinking of the ship.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: Two men were playing tennis. They played five sets and each man won three sets. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'They were playing tennis in turns.', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is because in doubles tennis, two players form a team and play against another team, so it is possible for each man to win three sets. In doubles, the team's combined sets won are counted, so each player winning three sets is entirely possible and would result in a tie. The other answer choices do not provide a plausible explanation for each man winning three sets in a five-set match.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.

Question  109
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is the best answer because the absence of dew indicates that the radishes were not freshly harvested from the farmer's farm that morning as he claimed. Dew typically forms overnight and would be present on freshly harvested produce in the morning. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim and led to his detention by the police.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: One morning a man is leaving on a business trip and finds he left some paperwork at his office. He runs into his office to get it and the night watchman stops him and says, "Sir, don't get on the plane. I had a dream last night that the plane would crash and everyone would die!" The man takes his word and cancels his trip. Sure enough, the plane crashes and everyone dies. The next morning the man gives the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life and then fires him. Why did he fire the watchman that saved his life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The watchman was fired for not warning the man in advance.', 'The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.', 'The man thought one thousand dollars is too much for a reward.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job" because the man gave the watchman a $1,000 reward for saving his life, indicating that he was grateful for the warning. However, the watchman's primary job was to keep watch and ensure the security of the building, not to be asleep on the job. The man likely fired the watchman for negligence in carrying out his duties, rather than for the warning about the plane crash.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because the question does not specify that the horse cannot move. Therefore, since the rope is not tied to anything else, the horse is free to move around within the five-meter radius circle, which allows it to reach the bale of hay ten meters away.
Question: When a woman is about to leave for an overseas conference, she realizes she left her presentation slides at her workplace. "Miss, don't board the ship," the security guard pleads as he stops her while she dashes into the office to fetch them. "I had a dream last night that the ship would sink and everyone aboard would drown." Heeding his warning, she decides not to go. As predicted, the ship sinks, with no survivors. The next day, the woman rewards the guard with a $5,000 bonus for saving her life before letting him go. Why did she dismiss the guard who saved her life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman thought five thousands dollars is too much for a reward.', 'The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty.', 'The watchman was fired for not warning the woman in advance.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty." This is because the woman dismissed the guard after rewarding him, indicating that there was a negative consequence for him despite saving her life. Additionally, the guard's warning was proven accurate, so the dismissal must have stemmed from another reason, such as neglecting his duty by sleeping on the job.
Question: Two cars were involved in an accident in the center of town. The man who was driving a little green car, had overtaken a big black car. The driver had misjudged the distance between him and the on-coming traffic and had to serve back in, causing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the occupants of the cars were examined everyone in the green car was okay, but in the black car was one dead man. However, the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter, why was this so? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral." This is the best answer because there was already a dead man in the black car, so the driver of the green car could not be charged with manslaughter for the death resulting from the accident. The presence of the deceased person in the black car explains why the driver of the green car was not charged.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was a Submarine." because a submarine sinking in the central Pacific Ocean would not necessarily be crushed, and it would not pose a threat to the different teams on board the ship. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can function without being crushed or causing immediate harm to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the unexpected sinking of a submarine would not necessarily alarm the different teams on board.
Question: An collision involving two automobiles occurred in the town center. A man driving a small green automobile had passed a large black car. The driver had underestimated the space between himself and oncoming traffic and had to service back in, forcing the black car to serve and crash into a shop window. When the passengers of the automobiles were investigated, everyone in the green car was fine, but there was one dead guy in the black car. Why, though, was the driver of the green automobile not charged with manslaughter? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The black car was an autonomous vehicle and had no living driver or passengers', 'The black car was a hears and was on its way to a funeral.', 'The police thought the traffic accident is not serious enough to fine the man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The black car was a hearse and was on its way to a funeral" because it explains why there was a dead person in the black car and why the driver of the green car was not charged with manslaughter. Since the black car was carrying a deceased person to a funeral, the death was not caused by the collision but rather the circumstances of the person being transported in the hearse. This explanation clears the driver of the green car from being charged with manslaughter in this particular situation.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write. Any error will be corrected by a delete device. It does not require any electricity to function. What is the cost? It's only a few pennies! How can the store earn a profit when it sells it so cheaply? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of computers in warehouse so they decided to start promotions.', 'The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.', 'The store stole steal this computer from others.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser" because the description matches that of a traditional pencil, which fits in your pocket, can write and erase, and does not require electricity to function. The cost is only a few pennies because it is a pencil, not an actual computer or word processor. Therefore, the store can earn a profit by selling pencils at a low cost.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the question suggests that the truck has already crossed half of the bridge without collapsing it, indicating that the weight of the truck alone did not exceed the bridge's weight limit. Therefore, using up the gas and making the truck lighter would allow it to safely cross the remaining half of the bridge.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: A cat was walking pass a security guard when the guard told him not to enter the area since it was restricted. However, the cat passed the security guard without any sense of obedience.Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The cat thought it won't bring danger", "Since cats can't understand humans' language", 'The cat thought it was hard to detect itself.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since cats can't understand humans' language". This is because cats do not have the ability to understand spoken language, so the cat would not have comprehended the security guard's warning. The cat's lack of obedience can be attributed to its inability to comprehend human communication, rather than a deliberate act of disobedience or calculation of potential danger.
Question: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The son has two fathers.', 'Because the doctor is the mother of the son.', 'The son calls the police for help to save his father.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This is because the statement "I can't operate on him. He's my son" indicates that the doctor is the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles and assumptions about professions, highlighting the importance of diversity and representation in all fields, including medicine.
Question: A guy buys a car that can go up to 55 mph, doesn't require any petrol nor electricity and also provide the solution for itself when it gets old. How's that possible to have a deal as good as this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The store had thounsands of items in warehouse so they provided free updations.', 'The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well.', 'The car is powered by an advanced form of solar energy absorption system.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The car is a horse that can give birth to baby horses as well." This is the best answer because it creatively reinterprets the concept of a "car" to be a living being (a horse) that can reproduce itself, eliminating the need for petrol or electricity and providing a solution for itself when it gets old. This answer fits the given criteria of going up to 55 mph without requiring petrol or electricity, and it provides a unique and clever solution for the car's longevity.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track. It addresses the specific scenario described in the question and accounts for the man's actions in a reasonable and realistic way, making it the most plausible choice.
Question: A logical with some time to kill in a small town decided to get a haircut. The town had only two barber, each with his own shop. The logical glance into one shop and saw that it was extremely until. The barber needed a shave, his clothes were unkempt, and his hair was badly cut. The other shop was extremely neat. The barber was freshly shaved and spotlessly dressed, his hair neatly trimmed. Why did the logical return to the first shop for his haircut? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept.

Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements.

Question  110
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because hurricanes are given human names, and Craig and Tracy are commonly used names for hurricanes. In Florida, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but would actually be delighted because it means the storm has passed. Similarly, at sea, people would not mourn the death of a hurricane, but rather feel relieved. Therefore, the fact that Craig and Tracy died and nobody mourned, but rather everyone was delighted, suggests that they were actually hurricanes.
Question: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were both hurricanes.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'People are getting used to it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were both hurricanes." This is the best answer because the passage is describing the deaths of two individuals, Craig and Tracy, and how no one was sad about it. The clue lies in the fact that "Tracy passed away at sea shortly after," indicating that Tracy was a storm at sea, and "Craig passed away there," suggesting that Craig was a storm that passed over a specific location. Therefore, the best answer is that they were both hurricanes.
Question: When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Laura wanted to be a surgeon.', "The parents known Laura was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'Her parents thought the job has high salary so they are excited.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Laura wanted to be a surgeon." This is because the description of slicing, dicing, and gutting aligns with the typical tasks of a surgeon in a medical setting. The parents' initial surprise followed by excitement suggests that they understood her career choice as a prestigious and highly skilled profession, rather than one of violence or harm.
Question: A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'His life is not worth living.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th." This is the best answer because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making the man's actual age 100 years old. Age is typically measured in years, so despite only celebrating 25 birthdays, his age would still be 100 years old based on the number of days he has lived.
Question: There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.", 'I was hiding in the bottom of one cars and no police found me.', "I was running so fast that even the police cars couldn't catch me.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I was the person who left the plan when we were working on the equipment." This is the best answer because it explains how the heist planner was able to avoid being caught by the police. By leaving the plan when additional people were being added and the heist was becoming more complex, the planner distanced themselves from the group and avoided being caught when the police apprehended the others.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He lived in a light house.', 'The man is a world-renowned botanist who has just moved into a new house with a rare greenhouse containing 365 unique and endangered plant species.', 'The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house". This is the best answer because it explains how the man could have turned out all the lights before going to bed and still not sleepwalk, as he would be used to the constant light in a lighthouse. It also addresses the fact that he "killed" 365 people, as the light in a lighthouse serves to guide ships away from danger, potentially saving lives. None of the other answer choices provide a logical explanation for the man's actions and the outcome.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was born on February 29th\n', 'The man is not healthy.', 'Family members are sick.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was born on February 29th" because February 29th only occurs once every four years, making it a rare occurrence. Since it's not a yearly occurrence, it's easy for family members to overlook or forget about his birthday in non-leap years. This unique birthdate could explain why no one mentioned John's birthday this year, despite the usual emphasis his family puts on birthdays.
Question: There were two bosses and two employees in a meeting room discussing different tasks. At the end of the meeting, there three tasks for all the people in that meeting. How is that possible Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss.", 'One boss gaves his fish to his employee.', 'Two employees shared the same task.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss." This explanation allows for two bosses and two employees in the meeting. One of the employees is also a boss, which can account for the three tasks assigned at the end of the meeting. This scenario logically explains how the situation is possible.
Question: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Matthew is a deep-sea diver.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Matthew was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Matthew is a deep-sea diver" because his behavior of making plans to visit a deep spot and plunging into profound depths indicates that he has experience and comfort with deep-sea diving. His lack of injury or harm may be attributed to his training, experience, and knowledge of safe diving practices. This explanation aligns with his behavior and the lack of harm despite his risky behavior.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the best answer because deflating the kayak slightly will reduce its size, allowing it to pass through the narrower section of the river. This solution addresses the specific problem of the kayak being too wide to navigate the narrow part of the river. The other options are not feasible or relevant to the situation. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective solution to Mary's predicament.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is because while both Juliana and Maria drank the same drinks, Juliana finished five before Maria finished one. The difference in their consumption rates would suggest that the poison was likely in the ice, as Juliana would have ingested more of it by consuming more drinks at a faster pace.
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This choice explains that Brad intentionally jumped and landed inside the building. It provides a logical and plausible explanation for how he survived the fall without any external factors such as a wet ground or his physical strength. This answer aligns with the details provided in the prompt and accounts for the unusual circumstances of the story.
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because it directly explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. The seeds would not cause the same harm as regular stones, as they are much lighter and less dense. This explanation fits perfectly with the situation described in the question.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the best answer because it explains why the farmer who was hit by the stones was not harmed. The stones were not actually stones but rather seeds, which would not cause harm upon impact. This explanation aligns with the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit with stones.
Question: The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.", 'Tiger eats the bishop slowly and bishop gets recovered everyday.', 'The bishop is a good person.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died." This is the best answer because without food for an entire year, the tiger would not have survived in the cell. Tigers can usually only go about two to three weeks without food before succumbing to starvation, so there is no way it could have been alive after a full year without food. Therefore, the bishop would have been unharmed and free after a month in the cell with a dead tiger.

Question  111
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is in liquid form and offers less resistance to the falling steel ball compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be in solid state as ice. This increased resistance causes the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Question: There is a bus full of people travelling over San Francisco and no one gets off the bus throughout the journey. But when it gets to the other side there is not a single person left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married." This is the best answer because the riddle is a play on the word "single." While the bus starts with people who are not single, when it gets to the other side, they all become "not single" in the sense that they are married, therefore there are no "single" people left on the bus. This answer provides a clever and logical explanation for the disappearance of the passengers.
Question: A horse was tied to a rope 5 meters long and the horses food was 15 meters away from the horse. How did the horse reach the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." because if the rope was not tied to anything, then the length of the rope would not restrict the horse from reaching the food. In this scenario, the horse would be able to walk freely to the food as if there were no rope attached to it at all. This solution directly addresses the problem of the rope's length being too short for the horse to reach the food.
Question: Four men sat down to play, and they played all night until the sun came up. They played for gold, not for pleasure, with individual scores for everyone. They had all earned good money when it came to square accounts. Can you explain the paradox: If no one loses, how can everyone win? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because musicians often play for gold (money) and keep individual scores for their performances. In this case, "playing for gold" refers to performing for money, and "individual scores" refers to the amount of money each musician earned. Therefore, in this context, playing for gold and having individual scores does not necessarily refer to playing a game, but rather to performing music.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['May 6th is holiday.', 'He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.', 'The boy drank a lot and slept at festival for 5 days.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1." This is the best answer because it provides a logical and plausible explanation for how the boy could have participated in a festival in Japan for five days before returning on the same date. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible solution to the question.
Question: There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 5th man beated them at the end.', 'He was dead and in a coffin.', 'The 5th man walked slowly to dodge the raining.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He was dead and in a coffin" because if the 5th man was in a coffin, he would not have been affected by the rain like the other men who were walking. This explanation fits with the fact that the 5th man did not speed up to avoid the rain, yet still arrived with the others but remained dry.
Question: When a woman is about to leave for an overseas conference, she realizes she left her presentation slides at her workplace. "Miss, don't board the ship," the security guard pleads as he stops her while she dashes into the office to fetch them. "I had a dream last night that the ship would sink and everyone aboard would drown." Heeding his warning, she decides not to go. As predicted, the ship sinks, with no survivors. The next day, the woman rewards the guard with a $5,000 bonus for saving her life before letting him go. Why did she dismiss the guard who saved her life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman thought five thousands dollars is too much for a reward.', 'The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty.', 'The watchman was fired for not warning the woman in advance.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty." This is because the woman dismissed the guard after rewarding him, indicating that there was a negative consequence for him despite saving her life. Additionally, the guard's warning was proven accurate, so the dismissal must have stemmed from another reason, such as neglecting his duty by sleeping on the job.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: There is a bus full of passengers traveling through San Francisco, and no one gets off the bus. However, when it reaches the opposite side, there isn't a single person remaining. What makes this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The passengers all hid themselves in the rear of the bus.', 'They are all married.', 'The passangers got off the bus through the window quietly.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are all married" because the question implies that no one gets off the bus, yet there are no passengers remaining when it reaches the opposite side. This suggests that the passengers are all connected or related in some way, and being married is a logical explanation for why none of them remain on the bus at the end of the journey. This answer is the most logical and fits the scenario described in the question.
Question: Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that the girls did not get wet because there was no rain. This explanation is simple, clear, and directly addresses the situation described in the question. The other answer choices introduce additional scenarios or assumptions that are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, "Because it was not raining" is the most logical and direct explanation for why the girls did not get wet while using the same umbrella.
Question: There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sorcerers decide to share one apple.', 'Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.', 'One sorcerers is polite and return the apple back.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is to hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This way, each of the first six sorcerers can take a bean from the vase, leaving one bean behind. When it is the seventh sorcerer's turn, they can simply be given the last bean that remains in the vase, thus ensuring that each sorcerer receives a bean while still leaving one in the vase. This satisfies the requirement of distributing the beans among the seven sorcerers while keeping one in the vase.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is the best answer because the paddle of water indicated that there was a block of ice that the man stood on to hang himself. As the ice melted, it left behind the paddle of water and the man appeared to be hanging with no apparent means of support. This explanation fits all the given evidence and solves the mystery of how the man hung himself in a room with no apparent way to do so.
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: Four men sat down to play, They played all night till the break of day. They played for gold and not for fun, With separate scores for every one. When they had come to square accounts, They all had made quite fair amounts. Can you explain the paradox, If no one lost, how all could gain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The men were miners..', 'The men were musicians..', 'The men were pokers..', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The men were musicians" because the paradox described in the riddle can only be resolved if the men were playing musical instruments and making music, rather than engaging in a game of chance or skill like poker or mining for gold. In this case, they would have played music and earned money through their performance, allowing them all to make fair amounts without anyone losing.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the key clue in the story - the fact that the woman was taken home at night and returned to the garden in the morning, which would result in her being the only plant without dew. This allows the husband to easily identify which rose bush is his wife, making it the most logical and accurate answer.

Question  112
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is the best answer because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water is below its freezing point and would solidify into ice, making it impossible for the steel ball to fall through. This explanation aligns with the impossibility of the scenario described in the question.

Answer Choices: ['Your friend has developed a unique technique using specialized magnetic attachments on the kite and a powerful electromagnet placed at a specific location.', 'The kite is too heavy to fly so the only reasonable answer is that the kite is always thrown towards the sky and because of its weight, it can be expected that at a particular time, it wil change directions and comes straight back to him.', 'The kite your friend has is made of a special material that is lighter than air. Despite its weight being stated as 10 kilograms, it actually has negative mass, allowing it to defy gravity. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The kite is too heavy to fly so the only reasonable answer is that the kite is always thrown towards the sky and because of its weight, it can be expected that at a particular time, it will change directions and come straight back to him." This is the best answer because it explains the phenomenon using the principle of gravity and the weight of the kite. The kite's weight makes it difficult to maintain flight, causing it to eventually change direction and return to the ground.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it logically explains why the logical would choose the first barber despite his untidy appearance. It suggests that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, indicating his skill and expertise, which would make the logical want to get a haircut from him.
Question: Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The salt and pepper are  expired.', "Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.", "All customers were polite and didn't tell them in public.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: This is the best answer because it explains that the chefs were making two different foods, so they didn't add the spices twice to the same food. This would result in the food not being too spicy, as each dish only received one addition of salt and pepper. It accounts for the lack of spiciness in the food despite both chefs using salt and pepper.
Question: One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The courier got lost and spent the whole year to find the way.', "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.", 'The pizza store was out of ingredients.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day" because it explains the delay in a logical way. If the lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, then it would make sense for her order to arrive the next year. This answer provides a clear and plausible explanation for the delay in the pizza delivery.
Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The 6th woman beated them at the end.', 'The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.', 'The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying." This explains how all six women reached the cabin at the same time, despite one of them not hurrying along. The others were cold because they were actually the ones hiking in the snow, while the sixth woman was not physically present, but instead represented in a photograph. This clever twist in the scenario explains the puzzling situation.
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and rational explanation for the logician's decision. It takes into account the information observed about both barbers and uses deductive reasoning to determine the most likely scenario.
Question: Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland" because the boat is already so close to the shoreline that they can simply step out onto the land. Since the water is only one meter deep, the fear of water, drowning, and sharks are not relevant in this situation. Walking onto the shoreline is the most practical and straightforward solution for them to reach land safely.
Question: There were twenty boys with different names in the classroom, All went up to the blackboard and wrote names on the board, however, there was only one name on the board, how's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other boys don't have names.", 'All is the name of one of the boys.', "Other boys don't know how to write.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "All is the name of one of the boys." This is the best answer because the word "All" is a valid name for one of the boys in the classroom. When they all went up to the blackboard and wrote their names, the name "All" was the only one that appeared on the blackboard, leading to the confusion. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the outcome.
Question: A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have earned doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as engineering, law, or philosophy. This explains how they are doctors without attending medical school. It also does not imply that they learned all their knowledge by themselves or that they are too busy to take courses in medical school, making it the most logical and plausible explanation.
Question: A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nHe can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.', 'He can wait until water level is high enough, he can safely step out of the pool. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep." Since the pool is only 1 meter deep, the man can easily stand up and wade to the edge of the pool. This simple solution avoids the need for swimming or any outside assistance.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is the best answer because it means that the horse is not actually constrained by the length of the rope. The rope is simply there as a formality, but it does not actually limit the horse's movement in any way. This allows the horse to reach the hay whenever it wants without severing the rope.
Question: When a woman is about to leave for an overseas conference, she realizes she left her presentation slides at her workplace. "Miss, don't board the ship," the security guard pleads as he stops her while she dashes into the office to fetch them. "I had a dream last night that the ship would sink and everyone aboard would drown." Heeding his warning, she decides not to go. As predicted, the ship sinks, with no survivors. The next day, the woman rewards the guard with a $5,000 bonus for saving her life before letting him go. Why did she dismiss the guard who saved her life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman thought five thousands dollars is too much for a reward.', 'The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty.', 'The watchman was fired for not warning the woman in advance.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty." This is because the woman dismissed the guard after rewarding him, indicating that there was a negative consequence for him despite saving her life. Additionally, the guard's warning was proven accurate, so the dismissal must have stemmed from another reason, such as neglecting his duty by sleeping on the job.
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." This is the best answer because the boat is already one meter from the shore, so the men can simply walk onto the shore from the boat. There is no need to wait for the water to evaporate or for the water level to rise. Therefore, walking onto the shore is the most practical and immediate solution.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is for the woman to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This ensures that she can obtain both food and water for survival. It is a practical and feasible solution given the limited resources available to her on the isolated island. It also avoids any unnecessary risks or actions, such as trying to hook onto a passing plane or eating non-edible items for energy.
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because it implies that the sons have attained doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as physics, philosophy, or other academic disciplines. This explanation aligns with the fact that they never attended medical school but are still considered doctors. Therefore, they have achieved advanced degrees in other fields, allowing them to be referred to as "doctors."
Question: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because if it was not raining, then there would be no need for the girls to share an umbrella and no one would get wet. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how all the girls could avoid getting wet while sharing one umbrella.
Question: Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it was not raining." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that the girls did not get wet because there was no rain. This explanation is simple, clear, and directly addresses the situation described in the question. The other answer choices introduce additional scenarios or assumptions that are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, "Because it was not raining" is the most logical and direct explanation for why the girls did not get wet while using the same umbrella.
Question: Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it.', 'Because it was not raining.', 'The umbrella that the girls were sharing was exceptionally large or had a wide canopy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it." This is the best answer because it provides a practical and feasible explanation for how none of the girls got wet while using the same umbrella. By taking turns or sharing the umbrella at different times, each girl could have avoided getting wet. This explanation does not make assumptions about the weather or the size of the umbrella, making it the most logical and plausible answer.

Question  113
Question: Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires" because reducing the air pressure in the tires would lower the overall height of the semi, allowing it to free itself from the overpass. This solution does not require any extreme measures like lifting or overturning the truck and is a practical and effective way to resolve the issue.
Question: A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking." This is the best answer because it gives a logical explanation for how a truck driver could go the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. If the truck driver was walking, then they were not operating a vehicle and therefore did not break any traffic laws.
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the best answer because if the swimmer was walking and not actually swimming in the designated lane, then they were not violating any pool rules. The lifeguards would not take action because the swimmer was not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the situation does not require any intervention from the lifeguards.
Question: A town that has been painted black has a black dog standing in the midst of an intersection. Due to a storm-related power outage, none of the street lights are functioning. When a car with two broken headlights approaches the dog, it turns away in time to miss him. How was the dog able to be seen by the driver in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'It was during the daylight hours.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because even though the town has been painted black and the street lights are not functioning due to a power outage, the scenario mentions nothing about it being night time. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is still daylight, allowing the driver to see the dog in time to avoid hitting it.
Question: A man was scaping from the police and he tried to scape by climbing up a wall and scape from the otherside, however police caught him and he was prisoned, although the policeman didn't climb up the wall. How's that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The police got the car and detoured from a long distance to reach the other side of the wall.', 'The police officer had a trained team of pigeons that were capable of flying to the other side of the wall and apprehending the man.', 'There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There was also a door from one side to the other side of the wall and policeman just opened the door and went to the other side." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the police were able to catch the man without climbing the wall. It does not involve any far-fetched or unlikely scenarios, such as detouring from a long distance or using trained pigeons. Instead, it simply suggests that there was a door on the wall that allowed the police to easily reach the other side.
Question: Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tried to get away from the police.', 'There is no people on that street.', 'The truck driver was walking.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The truck driver was walking" because it is a play on words. Since the prompt specifies that the truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street, it suggests that the truck driver literally walked down the one-way street, rather than driving a truck. This is a clever and unexpected twist on the wording of the question.
Question: A girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and parties for 3 days and came back on the 4th of July. How did she do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['July 7th is holiday.', 'The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it provides a clever solution to the riddle. The wording of the question is tricky, making it seem like the girl went over and came back on the same day. However, the answer reveals that she actually went over on the 4th of July and came back on a boat named the July 4, cleverly turning the question itself into a play on words.
Question: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['George get to the roof and escape.', 'George needs to lift a heavy object.', 'George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." because it is the most practical and logical solution to his predicament. Since he was cleaning the inside of the windows, he would have been inside the building and therefore able to access the stairs. Additionally, walking down the stairs is the safest and most reliable way for him to get down in the event of a power failure. The other answer choices (escaping to the roof or lifting a heavy object) do not address the immediate need to safely descend from the eighteenth floor during a power failure.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['All his neighbors are blind.', 'The man would wake up early.', 'He lived in a light house.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He lived in a light house." This makes sense because a lighthouse is a tall building with a strong light at the top, which is meant to be bright and visible for long distances. Therefore, it would not be unusual for the neighbors to be accustomed to the man's bright light if he lived in a lighthouse. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and provides a logical reason for the neighbors not complaining about the bright light.
Question: Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The snow angel will move all over around with snow.', 'The reflection by the snow let she saw the snow angel.', 'She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She was moving backwards while making the snow angel." This is the best answer because it explains how the woman could see her snow angel clearly without turning around. By moving backwards while making the snow angel, she would be able to see her creation as she made it, without having to turn around. This explanation fits the scenario given in the question and is the most logical reason for the woman to see her snow angel without turning around.
Question: The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I standed on others to reduce impact.', 'I quickly jumped when the moment the elevator hit the ground.', 'I got off on the first floor.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "I got off on the first floor." This is the best answer because it is the only logical explanation of how the individual survived the elevator crash. By getting off on the first floor, the individual was not in the elevator when it crashed, thereby avoiding the fatal impact. This is the only option that explains the individual's survival.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a machine to cut her hair, which led to 20 pounds lost.', ' When the woman pressed the button, she triggered a high-intensity exercise machine in the room. After a grueling workout, she lost 20 pounds.', 'The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower. This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the sudden weight loss without relying on unlikely or absurd scenarios. It also aligns with scientific principles of weight and gravitational force.
Question: A man who lived on the top floor of a twenty story building had to go up and down daily for work, and of course, for food and the other necessities. On most days he could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story, and he would have to walk the rest of the way. When it rained, however, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor, so he could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella and used it to press the 20th story button. This answer is the best because it provides a logical and creative explanation for the man's ability to ride all the way up to the twentieth floor when it rained, solving the puzzle presented in the question.

Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.

Question  114
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because as a circus performer and adept juggler, Robert can easily juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at a time, thus never exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. This solution allows him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures.
Question: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The coach of the team is the boy's mother.", "The boy's father gets a promotion.", 'The boy has two fathers.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The coach of the team is the boy's mother." This is the best answer because it explains how the coach can refer to the boy as "my son" even though the man at the baseball game is the boy's father. It reveals that the coach is the boy's mother, allowing for both statements to be true.
Question: The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were the same man.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were the same man." This is because it is logically impossible for two individuals to have the same parents but not be brothers unless they are the same person. This situation can only be possible in the case of a hypothetical or fictional scenario where a person serves as both the 22nd and 24th president. Therefore, the answer choice "They were the same man" is the only logical explanation for this scenario.
Question: Why is it so cold on Christmas? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because it's in December.", 'Because people are waiting for the New Year.', 'Because people are celebrating.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it's in December." because December is typically a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, bringing colder temperatures. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder weather during this time of year. This explanation provides a scientific reason for the cold temperatures during Christmas.
Question: All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver was good at listening.', 'The driver was paying much attention on the road.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because the scenario is described as happening in a town with the electricity out, but there is no mention of it being nighttime. Additionally, the presence of a moon is mentioned, indicating that it is daytime. Therefore, the driver was able to see the boy because there was still natural light available.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is the best answer because if the glass was filled with something other than water, then it would not spill when dropped onto the carpet. A magician could have used a clear gel or another substance that looks like water but has a higher viscosity, preventing it from spilling when the glass is dropped.
Question: Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.", 'Cleopatra and Anthony drowned in the fishbowl.', 'Cleopatra and Anthony got attacked by the fish in the bowl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water." This is the best answer because it is the most logical and makes the most sense given the information provided. Being near a fish tank would suggest that Cleopatra and Anthony were fish themselves, and perished because they were unable to survive without water. The other answer choices involving drowning or being attacked by fish are not supported by the information given.
Question: One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['John wanted to be a photographer.', 'John wants to be a video game designer  and his parent are addicted to vedio gams.', "The parents known John was kiding and didn't pay attention.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "John wanted to be a photographer." This is the best answer because it provides a non-violent career choice that aligns with the parents' non-violent nature. The other answer choices do not accurately explain why his parents would be proud of his career choice and do not align with the parents' non-violent nature.
Question: A boat on the lake included four men. All four men on the boat sink to the bottom of the lake when it flips over. However, not a single man gets wet! Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because they were all married and not single.', 'The lake was frozen, none of the men got wet despite sinking to the bottom.', "Despite the boat turning over and sinking, the water level was not high enough to reach the men's bodies.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because they were all married and not single." This is the best answer because the question is a play on words - while it initially appears to refer to getting wet with water, it actually refers to being single versus being married. This answer is clever and fits the question perfectly, making it the best choice.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the best answer because it explains the reason for the woman's initial movement towards the bear, as she had no immediate escape route due to being on a narrow mountain path. The woman's decision to initially move towards the bear allowed her to create distance and relative motion, giving her time to safely step off the path and avoid a potential encounter with the bear.
Question: Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents" because it is not possible for two people to both win a game of chess against each other. In chess, there can only be one winner. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that they were playing separate games against different opponents and both emerged victorious in their respective games. This scenario is the only plausible way for both to win in a game of chess.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is the best answer because it provides a simple and logical explanation for how the driver could have seen the black dog in time to avoid hitting it, despite the lack of functioning street lights and broken headlights. During the daylight hours, there is natural light that could have illuminated the dog, allowing the driver to see it in time to avoid a collision. The other answer choices do not provide a sufficient explanation for how the driver could have seen the dog in time.
Question: At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["There is no smoke. it's an electric train!", " Wind is blowing northeast and is more powerful than the train's speed, it would overpower the train's forward motion. It would likely cause the smoke to blow in northeast.", 'The train is traveling at a higher speed, which has a significant impact on the direction of the smoke. In this case, smoke is blowing to the opposite direction, north.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "There is no smoke. it's an electric train!" because electric trains do not produce smoke. The presence of a northeast wind or the train's speed does not affect the direction of smoke because there is simply no smoke being emitted from an electric train. Therefore, the answer effectively addresses the question by providing the correct information about electric trains and their lack of smoke production.
Question: Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy. When he got back, he didn't get any medals or any praises. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.", 'Jimy was really sweaty and smells.', 'Jimy is could not lift the trophy because it was too heavy.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why Jimy did not receive any medals or praises for bombarding the enemy territories - because Jimy is not a person, but rather the name of a fighter-jet. Therefore, it would not be expected for a fighter-jet to receive medals or praises.
Question: Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were playing against other opponents.', 'The both lose, in fact, which is also both won.', "The referee is new and doesn't know the chess rules.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were playing against other opponents." because if both players were playing against different opponents, it is possible for both of them to win their individual games. This would result in both players winning their matches. The other answer choices do not provide a feasible explanation for both players winning.
Question: Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Johnny burried one gold in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Johnny sank the gold to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the best answer because it explains how Johnny was able to safely cross the bridge without exceeding the weight limit. By constantly juggling the three gold coins while walking across the bridge, Johnny was able to distribute the weight and keep it below the maximum limit of 80 kilos. This solution is both logical and entertaining, fitting for a party clown like Johnny.
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It was day time." This is the best answer because if it was daytime, the driver would have been able to see the man dressed in all black, even though the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see the man's silhouette against the background, allowing them to be aware of his presence. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because it was daytime and they could see him.
Question: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.', 'Some rounds ended in ties or draws.', 'The board game takes a long time to end.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is 'The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.' because this situation allows for each person to win twice while playing four rounds. In a team setting, both players on the winning team would be credited with a win, and since there are two teams, each player could win twice. This accounts for the scenario presented in the question and logically explains how it is possible for each person to win twice in four rounds.
Question: Two men were playing tennis. They played five sets and each man won three sets. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'They were playing tennis in turns.', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is because in doubles tennis, two players form a team and play against another team, so it is possible for each man to win three sets. In doubles, the team's combined sets won are counted, so each player winning three sets is entirely possible and would result in a tie. The other answer choices do not provide a plausible explanation for each man winning three sets in a five-set match.
Question: The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is the best answer because in a doubles tennis match, two players are on each team, and each team can win three sets, resulting in a total of five sets played. Therefore, it is conceivable for each man to win three sets in the five that were played because they were in a doubles match.
Question: The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The two men were partners playing doubles.', 'TUmNioAvy4g4yjtpm7NddBi9chAAB9RUep', 'They followed a round-robin format, where each player competes against every other player in the tournament.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." This is the best answer because in a doubles tennis match, two players are on each team, and each team can win three sets, resulting in a total of five sets played. Therefore, it is conceivable for each man to win three sets in the five that were played because they were in a doubles match.

Question  115
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the conditions given in the question - that all of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. This means she must have one cat and one dog, as stated in the answer choice. This is the only answer choice that fits all the conditions given in the question.
Question: Apricot Jam was being made by Morgan. She stirred the apricots in the pot after adding them all. It was then that she realized she needed to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots! How did she calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is an execellent chef.', 'She is good at physicis.', 'She counted the pits of apricots.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She counted the pits of apricots." This is the best answer because in order to determine the appropriate amount of lemon juice, Morgan needed to know the number of apricots she had added to the pot. By counting the pits of the apricots, she could easily determine the correct amount of lemon juice to add based on the ratio of 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass had a chemical component to produce water.', 'The water vapor in the air become water in the drinks.', 'The ice in the drinks melted and become water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The ice in the drinks melted and became water" because when Juliana was drinking her five drinks, the ice would have melted, adding more liquid to the drinks. When she left and came back, the melted ice would have replaced some of the liquid she had drunk, giving the appearance of new liquid in the drinks without anyone else being present. This explanation fits the scenario and does not require any outside interference or unnatural processes.
Question: Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two girls decide to share one apple.', 'One girl is polite and return her apple back.', 'Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket." This is the best answer because it follows the given conditions - each girl gets an apple, and one apple remains in the basket. This solution does not involve sharing or returning the apple, ensuring that each girl gets an apple and one remains in the basket.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: There are 3 apples available for 2 fathers and 2 boys to consume. They each receive a single apple. How is it a mathematical possibility? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Two sons shared the same apple.', 'One father gave his apple to his son.', 'They are one son, one father and one grandfather.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They are one son, one father and one grandfather." This is the best answer because it allows for each person to receive an apple without anyone having to share or give up their own. It accounts for the 2 fathers, 2 boys, and the 3 apples by including a grandfather in the scenario, creating a mathematical possibility for each person to receive a single apple.
Question: A man who lived on the top floor of a twenty story building had to go up and down daily for work, and of course, for food and the other necessities. On most days he could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story, and he would have to walk the rest of the way. When it rained, however, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. ', 'The building had a system in place where, during rainy conditions, certain residents were granted exclusive access to the higher floors. ', "The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is that the man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor, so he could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella and used it to press the 20th story button. This answer is the best because it provides a logical and creative explanation for the man's ability to ride all the way up to the twentieth floor when it rained, solving the puzzle presented in the question.
Question: A person was outside when it started snowing heavily. Even though he was directly exposed to the snowfall without any protection, not a single snowflake landed on his hair. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'The man succeeded in avoiding all snow flake.', 'He is bold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bold." This is because the scenario described in the question is likely a play on the phrase "not a hair out of place," meaning the person managed to avoid being affected by the heavy snowfall despite being directly exposed to it. It is a clever twist on the traditional idea of not a single hair being out of place, and the answer "He is bold" plays on this clever wordplay.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.
Question: Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she still read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Sally is smart that she remembered all chapters in Bible.', 'Because it was daytime.', 'Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille." This is the best answer because it explains how Jessica was able to read the Bible every night before bed even when the electricity went out and she didn't have candles. By using Braille, Jessica could read the Bible without needing any additional light sources. This answer provides a logical and practical explanation for how Jessica was able to continue her routine even without electricity.
Question: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is the best answer because it satisfies the given conditions - all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. Therefore, she must have one of each, resulting in a total of two pets. The other answer choices do not accurately fit the conditions given in the question.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: A girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and parties for 3 days and came back on the 4th of July. How did she do that? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['July 7th is holiday.', 'The girl drank a lot and slept at party for 3 days.', 'She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4" because it provides a clever solution to the riddle. The wording of the question is tricky, making it seem like the girl went over and came back on the same day. However, the answer reveals that she actually went over on the 4th of July and came back on a boat named the July 4, cleverly turning the question itself into a play on words.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: A new explorer got lost while travelling. She decided to walk 3 miles to the south and made an eastward turn, and ran 3 miles. Suddenly she realized it was the wrong way then she decided to walk 3 miles to the north. Amazingly, she went back to the point of departure. Where is she? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Equator.\n', 'South Pole.', 'North Pole.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the North Pole. When the explorer walked 3 miles south and then made an eastward turn, she effectively started walking in circles around the North Pole. By walking 3 miles to the north, she completed the circle and returned to her point of departure. This scenario is only possible near the North Pole, where walking in a small circle will bring a person back to the same spot. Therefore, the best answer is the North Pole.
Question: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Cafe.', 'Bakery.', 'Clock store.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Clock store" because Emily needs to find out the time and the most logical place to do that would be a store that sells clocks. The other options (cafe and bakery) do not provide a solution for finding out the time. Therefore, the clock store is the best choice for Emily to find out what time it is.
Question: A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ? Choose the best answer choice.

Answer Choices: ['Each player shares the same coach.', 'Some players are backups and not allowed to play.', 'Some coaches get a raise.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is because in a chess team, it is common for multiple players to be coached by the same person. In this scenario, the five players on the team each have one coach, but it is possible that they share the same coach. This explanation accounts for the discrepancy of having only six participants in the team.
Question: What question can someone ask all day long, always get completely different answers, and yet all the answers could be correct? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['What time is it?', "What's the square root of 16?", 'What is the result of 5317 by 9321.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "What time is it?" because the answer will change throughout the day, depending on the time. Different people in different locations will provide different answers, and all of them could be correct. Additionally, time is a constantly changing and subjective measurement, making it the perfect question to receive completely different yet correct answers all day long.
Question:  A hiker arrives near a lake. He sees a sign where it is written "No swimming allowed.", but the duck jumps into the water. Why?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because ducks can't read.", "Because ducks won't polluted water.", 'Because ducks are tiny to be detected.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because ducks can't read." simply because ducks are not capable of understanding written signs or regulations. The other options do not provide a logical explanation as to why the duck would ignore the sign. Ducks being unable to read is the most straightforward and reasonable explanation for the duck's behavior.
Question: Three people are stuck inside a dark cave. The first fears the complete darkness, the second fears bats, and the third fears getting lost. They don't have any flashlights, lanterns or any kind of light source, and their cell phones have no signal so they can't use them as a light source either. How do they get out of the cave? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.", 'They run over around the whole cave and find the way out.', 'They try to run away from the bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the problem of darkness without any light sources. If it's daytime outside the cave, there will be natural light, which allows them to navigate and find their way out without being hindered by their fears. This solution also does not involve any unnecessary or dangerous actions, making it the safest and most practical option.
Question: There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One person already at the south side of the river.', 'They both jump to the south side.', 'One men go home to get a another boat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "One person already at the south side of the river." because it is the only plausible explanation given the constraints of the situation. Since the riddle states that only one person can fit on the boat, and there is no mention of the person being able to swim or another boat being available, the only logical conclusion is that there was already someone on the south side of the river. Therefore, this answer aligns with the given information and provides a feasible solution to the riddle.
Question: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.", ' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because biologically, roosters do not have the ability to lay eggs. Only hens have the reproductive system necessary to produce eggs. Therefore, it is not possible for a rooster to lay an egg, and the scenario described in the question is not biologically possible. Therefore, this answer logically explains the situation.
Question: Some months have eight letters in their name, whereas others have five. How many have three?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They all do.', 'June.', 'August.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They all do" because there are 12 months in a year, and all of them have three letters in their name (January, May, and March). So, all months have three letters in their name. Therefore, "They all do" is the correct answer.
Question: Why you go to gym everyday, but still can't do a marathon in New York. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Since you're not in new york to do the marathon", 'The marathon in New York is expensive and unaffordable.', 'You will need government permission to do marathon in New York.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "since you're not in New York to do the marathon" because it directly addresses the contradiction between going to the gym every day and not being able to do a marathon in New York. It suggests that the reason for not being able to do the marathon is due to the location, not because of any lack of physical fitness or training. This answer provides a clear and logical explanation for the situation.
Question: Each and every day, a man gets up early to work out. He always spends a few hours running about his apartments. He surprises himself by discovering that, after a month of hard training, his left leg has acquired much more muscle than his right. How is that feasible since the man is normal and healthy? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than inside leg.', 'Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.', 'He may have a subtle bias or preference for using his right leg more than his left.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is, "The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than the inside leg." This is the best answer because when running in a circular clockwise direction, the outer leg (the left leg in this case) will cover a greater distance than the inner leg due to the arc of the circle. This discrepancy in distance covered by each leg could lead to the left leg gaining more muscle mass than the right. Therefore, this answer provides a logical explanation for why the left leg acquired more muscle after a month of hard training.
Question: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Because roosters don't lay eggs.", 'His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.', 'Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because roosters don't lay eggs." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the issue of not getting any eggs from the roosters. It explains that the farmer did not receive any eggs because roosters are not capable of laying eggs, as only hens can lay eggs. Therefore, it provides a logical and straightforward explanation for the farmer's lack of eggs despite providing food for the roosters.
Question: In a grocery store, a man fills a shopping basket. He walks out of the store without paying, and no one stops him or calls the cops. Why? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man was able to walk out of the store without paying and without anyone stopping him. It also aligns with a plausible scenario in a grocery store setting.
Question: A girl slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The well is dry.', 'The well is too deep.', 'The water is too hot.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The well is dry." This is the best answer because if the well did not have any water in it, then the girl would not have gotten wet when she fell in. This explanation makes logical sense and is the most reasonable explanation for how the girl did not get wet after falling into the well. Therefore, "The well is dry" is the best answer.
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food," because if the rope is not tied to anything, it would not restrict the horse's movement, allowing it to reach the food 15 meters away. This is the most logical and straightforward explanation for how the horse was able to reach its food despite being tethered to a 5-meter long rope.

This is the only option that directly addresses having an unfair advantage in the exam session.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because the statement is factually accurate and directly addresses the reason why natives living in the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs. Since penguins only live in Antarctica, it would be physically impossible for Arctic natives to obtain penguin eggs for consumption. Therefore, this answer provides a logical and straightforward explanation for why Arctic natives would never eat penguin eggs.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the best answer because it directly addresses the fact that penguins and their eggs are not available in the Arctic, therefore not part of the traditional or cultural diet of the natives. This explanation aligns with the question's emphasis on the natives of the Arctic, ensuring that it specifically addresses why they would not eat a penguin's egg.
Question: A man was staring out a sixth-floor window when he decided to jump. He did not perish or get any injuries. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.', 'He was as strong as a superman to avoid hurt.', 'He used the collision between his body and walls to slow down.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it." because it provides a logical explanation for why the man did not perish or get injured after jumping from the sixth floor. If he was outside the window to wash it, then he would have been attached to a safety harness or rope, which would have prevented him from falling to the ground. This explanation is the most plausible and realistic, given the circumstances described.
Question: A man was born in 1898. He is still alive now at the age 33  How is this possible ? Choose the best answer choice.

Best Answer: The best answer is "he was born in room 1898 in the hospital" because it provides a logical and plausible explanation. The statement "He never celebrate his birthday after 33 years old" does not explain how he could still be alive at the age of 33, and "His birthday is February 29th, which is celebrated every four years" does not make sense as it would only make him 8 years old in leap years. Therefore, the explanation that he was born in room 1898 in the hospital is the most likely reason for his longevity.

Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica" because it directly addresses the fact that penguins and their eggs are not available in the Arctic, therefore not part of the traditional or cultural diet of the natives. This explanation aligns with the question's emphasis on the natives of the Arctic, ensuring that it specifically addresses why they would not eat a penguin's egg.

Question  118
Question: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The intense weather conditions flood the marina.', 'The boat is towed by police.', "The station wasn't fixed in the marina", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The station wasn't fixed in the marina" because if the station was not properly secured or fixed in the marina, it could easily come loose and allow the boat to drift away. This scenario would explain how the boat ended up in the middle of the ocean a couple of hours later. The other answer choices do not adequately explain how the boat could have ended up in the ocean from being parked in the marina.
Question: A person was outside when it started snowing heavily. Even though he was directly exposed to the snowfall without any protection, not a single snowflake landed on his hair. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'The man succeeded in avoiding all snow flake.', 'He is bold.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He is bold." This is because the scenario described in the question is likely a play on the phrase "not a hair out of place," meaning the person managed to avoid being affected by the heavy snowfall despite being directly exposed to it. It is a clever twist on the traditional idea of not a single hair being out of place, and the answer "He is bold" plays on this clever wordplay.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper" because her behavior of jumping from a high spot when feeling sad or depressed, her lack of injuries, and her feeling better afterwards all point to the fact that she is engaging in the sport of skydiving or base jumping. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the outcomes she experiences, and it accounts for the lack of injury or death despite her risky actions.
Question: In 1250, a woman is 30 years old. In 1240, the same woman is 20 years old. How can this be possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The genes in person is unnormal as others.', 'This woman wanted to stay younger so she revised his birthday.', 'The years are being counted in B.C', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The years are being counted in B.C." In 1250 BC, the woman was 30 years old, and in 1240 BC, she was 20 years old. In this case, the years are being counted backward, as BC (Before Christ) is a countdown from the supposed year of the birth of Jesus. Therefore, the woman's age being 30 in 1250 BC and 20 in 1240 BC is possible because the years are being counted in reverse.
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up" because by kicking the ball up into the air, the force of the kick and the angle at which the ball was kicked allowed it to travel a shorter distance before falling back to the ground. This action made it seem like the ball miraculously returned to the youngster, but in reality, it was just a result of the way the ball was kicked. The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for how the ball could have returned to the youngster.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the best answer because it explains that Lily did not actually step off the balcony despite feeling overwhelmed with fatigue. Instead, she simply opened the door and stepped back into the apartment. This explanation aligns with the fact that she was unscathed after the supposed step, as there was no actual drop or impact that could have caused her harm.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the best answer because it directly explains the presence of two bodies surrounded by water and shattered glass. The other answer choices do not fit the scenario as well as this one, as there is no indication of children or cold water causing the deaths. This answer also provides a logical and coherent explanation for the situation described.
Question: Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One piece of pizza is enough for two girls.', 'One mother gave her pizza to two girls.', "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter." This answer makes sense because there are three people in the group - the grandmother, the mother, and the daughter. The grandmother is a mother and a daughter, the mother is a mother and a daughter, and the daughter is a daughter. Therefore, there are two mothers and two daughters, but only three people in total, which explains how only three slices of pizza were eaten.
Question: Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. Each took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Several kings refused to take peach as the action was implite.', 'The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This is because the riddle plays with the wording of "each took one" to create a play on words, meaning that each of the kings, whose name is "Each," took one peach, leaving 49 on the tree. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the riddle.
Question: A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['One camel had moved away from the group when the peasant was counting.', 'The peasant is mistakenly considering himself as one of the camels when he counts them.', 'When he is on the camel he omits to count it.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "When he is on the camel he omits to count it." This is the best answer because the peasant counts 29 when he is off the camel, and 30 when he is on the camel. This inconsistency suggests that he is not counting the camel he is riding. Additionally, when he dismounts and counts again, he finds 30, which confirms that he was omitting to count the camel he was on.
Question: How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity causes the ball to return to the boy on its own, without the need for any external help like wind or a rope.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is the second door with the lions. The lions that haven't eaten in 5 years would have likely died of starvation. This would make it the safest option among the three doors, as the other options (fire and lava or a 1,000-foot drop into alligators) would likely result in certain death.
Question: A man grabbed a woman's ring and pulled on it, then dropped it. How did this save her life? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The ring is too heavy that limited woman's daily life.", 'The woman was crazy about her ring and lose the tenet of her own life.', 'They were skydiving, and she was unconscious. ', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "They were skydiving, and she was unconscious." This is the best answer because in a skydiving scenario, the ring getting pulled on may have jolted the woman awake, allowing her to deploy her parachute and saving her life. None of the other answer choices provide a plausible explanation for how the man grabbing the ring and dropping it would save her life.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day" because it is the only option that provides a reasonable explanation for how the bill was paid without Tom and Joe having to pay. The other answer choices do not logically explain how the bill was taken care of, while the mention of a third person, Wednesday, implies that this person could have been the one who paid the bill.
Question: There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The peach tree grew new peaches when the kings were taking.', 'Several kings refused to take peach as the action is implite.', "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one." This answer makes sense because "Each" is actually a proper noun representing one of the kings, so when it says "each took one," it means each of the kings took one peach. This explains why there were still 49 peaches left after all the kings took one.
Question: Ten pears hung high, ten men passed past, Each taking a fruit and leaving nine hanging there. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Other men can't reach the pear.", "Other men didn't see the pear.", 'EACH is the name of one of the men.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "EACH is the name of one of the men." This is because the word "Each" is indicating that the name of one of the men is actually "Each", and not making a statement about the action being performed. This clever wordplay allows for the riddle to be solved with a simple explanation.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the best answer because it provides a clear and logical reason for why the man charged towards the train before finally jumping off the track. Being on a bridge would have limited his options for safely getting off the track, leading to the decision to charge towards the train briefly before finding a suitable place to jump off.
Question: A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
 Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the cat can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', "The cat's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because the weight of the gas in the car would have been consumed during the long distance drive, thereby reducing the overall weight of the car below the maximum weight limit of the elevator. This explains why the elevator was able to function normally despite the car being at its maximum weight capacity.
Question: A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." This is the best answer because as the truck has traveled half of the bridge's length, it should have used up some amount of gas, thus reducing its weight slightly. Therefore, the weight of the truck combined with the weight of the bird landing on it would now be less than the bridge's weight limit, preventing it from collapsing. This is a logical and reasonable explanation for why the bridge did not collapse when the bird landed on the truck.
Question: A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is because the magician likely filled the glass with a clear, colorless substance that looks like water, such as a clear gel or silicone, which would not spill when the glass is dropped. This explanation accounts for the appearance of a full glass of water without any spillage when dropped from a height of six feet.

Question  119
Question: Which would you light first if you were alone in a dark room with just one match with an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to select from? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Candle.', 'Oil.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because if you were alone in a dark room with just one match, it would be more logical to use the match to try to find an exit or light switch, rather than risking using it to light any of the three options. Lighting any of the options would also not guarantee an immediate source of light for finding your way out of the room. Therefore, it's best to conserve the match and use it to navigate the dark room instead.
Question: If we have two bulls, and each cow can produce two gallons of milk every day. How much milk do we have after 2 days? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Eight.', 'Four.', 'Sixteen.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above" because the information provided does not specify the number of cows. Without knowing the number of cows, we cannot accurately calculate the total amount of milk produced in 2 days. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of milk produced with the information given.
Question: A PC has a bomb on top of it. A phone, a comb, keys, and a cup are arranged around the computer. Which object is destroyed first when the explosion occurs? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The phone.', 'The hairbush.', 'The cup.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above." The explosion would likely destroy all the objects simultaneously, as they are all in close proximity to the bomb. The force of the explosion would be powerful enough to affect all the objects at the same time, rather than destroying one before the others. Therefore, none of the objects would be destroyed first.
Question:  Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The way to the pond.', 'Home.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question does not specify the location of the rest of the ducks. It only provides information about five ducks getting lost, thirteen staying home, and nine being at the pond. Therefore, we cannot determine the location of the rest of the ducks based on the given information.
Question: A man is a chef with five dishes to make in half an hour: Crispy Smashed Potatoes, Picadillo, Zuppa Toscana, Classic Pot Roast, and also potatoes. Which one does he have to make first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Classic Pot Roast.', 'Picadillo.', 'Crispy Smashed Potatoes.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the chef needs to prioritize his time based on cooking methods and timings rather than the specific dishes. For example, the Crispy Smashed Potatoes and Classic Pot Roast might require longer cooking times compared to the Picadillo or Zuppa Toscana. Therefore, he should prioritize dishes that require longer cooking times first to ensure everything is ready on time.
Question:  Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?  Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Home.', 'The way to the pond.', 'Pond.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because it does not fit any of the given options. The question does not provide a specific location for the remaining ducks, so we cannot determine where they are from the information given. Therefore, "None of above" is the most accurate answer.
Question: If a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird are racing to the top of a coconut tree, who will get the banana first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'The bird.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because the question mentions a coconut tree, which does not produce bananas. Therefore, none of the animals will be able to get a banana from the coconut tree. This answer takes into account the specifics of the question and the characteristics of the animals and the tree mentioned.
Question: Ten fish are in a tank. Two fish drown. Four fish swim away.Three fish die.
How many fish are left in the tank? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven.', 'Five.', 'Twenty.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above." While the scenario presents a situation where some fish are removed or die, it is not possible for fish to "drown" or "swim away" as these actions only apply to creatures outside of water. Therefore, the concept of fish "drowning" or "swimming away" is logically impossible, and therefore none of the answer choices accurately reflect the situation described.
Question: A grenade is in a shopping bag. Around the bag, there is a smartphone, a wallet, a bottle of water, and a book. When the detonation occurs, which item is damaged first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The wallet.', 'The book.', 'The smartphone.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because none of the items listed have the ability to withstand a grenade detonation without being damaged. While the smartphone and wallet may provide some level of protection to the items inside the bag, ultimately, the force and shrapnel from the explosion would damage all the items simultaneously. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which item would be damaged first.
Question: A group of ten ostriches are in a field. If four of them take off flying, how many are left in the field? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." Ostriches are flightless birds, so it is impossible for them to take off flying. Therefore, all ten ostriches would still be left in the field. This choice is the best because it accurately reflects the biology of ostriches and the impossibility of them flying.
Question: Ten chickens are gathered in a field. How many of them remain on the field if four of them take off flying? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Six.', 'Four.', 'Ten.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because the question asks how many chickens remain on the field after four of them take off flying. Therefore, if four chickens take off flying, none of them remain on the field. Therefore, the correct answer is "None of above."
Question: How can you lift an elephant with one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Crane.', 'Forklift.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." because it is physically impossible to lift an elephant with one hand, regardless of the equipment used. Elephants are extremely heavy animals, with adult elephants weighing several thousand pounds. Even with the most advanced technology or strong machinery, it is not possible for a human to lift an elephant with just one hand. Therefore, the best answer is that it cannot be done.
Question: A tank contains ten fish. Two fish drown. Four fish are swimming away.Three fish perish. How many fish are there left in the tank? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven.', 'Twenty.', 'Five.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because fish do not drown, they also do not perish, and it is not mentioned that any fish are removed from the tank. Therefore, all ten fish are still in the tank even though some might be swimming away.
Question: How to carry an elephant on one hand? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Forklift.', 'Crane.', 'Hydraulic Jacks.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." It is not physically possible to carry an elephant on one hand, regardless of the equipment or tools mentioned. Elephants are extremely heavy, with an average weight of around 8,000 to 12,000 pounds, and cannot be lifted by a single human hand. Therefore, the best answer is to acknowledge that it is not possible to carry an elephant on one hand.
Question: If you were alone in a dark room, with only one match and an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to choose from, which would you light first? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Oil.', 'Candle.', 'Fireplace.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above" because before I light any of the options, I should first light the match in order to be able to light anything else. Therefore, the first step would be to light the match itself.
Question: We have 5 roosters and each one gives 1 egg per day. How many eggs do we have after a week? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Five.', 'Thirty-five.', 'Seven.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. Therefore, the question contains a mistake and none of the provided answer choices are correct.
Question: Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The bird.', 'The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of the above" because coconut trees do not bear bananas, so none of the animals would be able to grab a banana. This answer is the most logical and accurate based on the information given in the question.
Question: Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Dolphin.', 'Dog.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is None of above. This is because all three animals have different levels of hearing abilities, and the ability to hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room would depend on various factors such as the frequency range of the sound and the sensitivity of their auditory system. Without specific information on the decibel level or frequency of the quietest sound, it is impossible to determine which animal would hear it. Therefore, it is most accurate to say that none of the animals listed would definitively hear the quietest sound without more specific information.
Question: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Owl.', 'Tiger.', 'Bat.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." While owls have excellent night vision, they cannot see in total darkness. Bats use echolocation to navigate in darkness but cannot "see" in the traditional sense. Tigers have good vision but cannot see in total darkness. Therefore, none of the given options can see most clearly in total darkness.
Question: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Tiger.', 'Owl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "None of above." This is because none of the given choices (tiger, bat, or owl) can see in complete darkness. While bats and owls have better night vision compared to many other animals, they still rely on low light levels to see, and cannot see in complete darkness. Therefore, none of the given choices can see in complete darkness.
Question: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl. Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Tiger.', 'Owl.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: Let's think step by step. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "None of above." This is because none of the given choices (tiger, bat, or owl) can see in complete darkness. While bats and owls have better night vision compared to many other animals, they still rely on low light levels to see, and cannot see in complete darkness. Therefore, none of the given choices can see in complete darkness.

Question  120
Question: A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, "That little girl was my daughter." How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is the best answer because it is the only plausible explanation for the secretary referring to the girl as "my daughter." If the secretary was not the girl's father, then the statement would not make sense. Therefore, this is the only logical explanation for the secretary's comment.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Best Answer: The best answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is the best answer because in order for one camel to be facing due East and the other to be facing due West, they must have been facing each other. This is the only way for them to be in opposite directions without moving their heads, walking around, or turning around. Therefore, this is the most logical and accurate explanation for how the camels can see each other without making any other movements.
Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.', 'The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.', 'The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.', 'None of above.']

Therefore, it is most likely that the crew were not actually cruising in the stormy sea.
