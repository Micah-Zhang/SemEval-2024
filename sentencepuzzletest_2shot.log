Question  1
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." The lifeguards did not take action because the individual was not actually swimming in the wrong direction, but rather walking in the shallow end of the pool. Therefore, there was no safety infraction to address.
Question: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He tries to be friendly.', 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He was the star baseball player.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is because despite his personal feelings about bats, he enjoys being called "Batman" due to the association with the popular comic book and movie character, who is also known as the Caped Crusader. As a star baseball player, he likely appreciates the comparison to a strong, heroic figure regardless of his feelings about real bats.

Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." The lifeguards didn't take action because the swimmer was not actually violating the one-way swimming lane rule - they were walking in the shallow end of the pool, not swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, there was no safety infraction for the lifeguards to address.
Question: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Mrs.Smith has one additional pet that is neither a dog or a cat.', 'Mrs.Smith has one hybrid pet that is a dog and a cat at the same time.', 'Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog." This is possible because "all of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one" means that one pet is a dog, and "all her pets are cats except one" means that the other pet is a cat. Therefore, Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog, and both statements are true.

Question  3
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is that the woman's sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense. This means that they have earned a doctorate degree in a field other than medicine, such as a PhD. This allows them to be called "doctors" without having attended medical school. It challenges the preconception that "doctors" only refer to medical doctors, when in fact it can also refer to those with a doctorate degree in any field.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died." This is the correct answer because lions cannot survive without food for such a long period, and it is highly unlikely that they would still be alive. Therefore, it would be safe to choose this door as the most probable way to get through.

Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer would be "The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it." This is the safest option because if the first door is destroyed and there is fire inside, it means there is no danger behind that door. The other options may involve potential danger, but the first door is the only one guaranteed to be safe.

Question  4
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver was able to see the man dressed in all black because it was daytime, allowing for visibility on the country lane. This means that even though the man's clothing was all black, the natural light of day made him visible to the car's driver. Therefore, the driver knew he was there because of the daylight, not because of any special attention or skill.
Question: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.", 'Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.', 'The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side." This is because the only way for them to stand on the same piece of newspaper without touching each other is by having the newspaper acting as a barrier between them. Placing the newspaper under a door allows for each sibling to stand on each side of the door, fulfilling the requirements of the punishment.

Question  5
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is because the rational individual noticed that the well-kept barber had received a better haircut from the untidy barber, indicating that the untidy barber was the better barber. Therefore, the logical chose to get his haircut at the first place he went based on the quality of the haircut seen on the well-kept barber, rather than the appearances of the barbers or their shops.
Question: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Fifteen dollars.', 'Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.', 'Twenty-five dollars.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume." The woman initially received a counterfeit $20 bill from the man, resulting in a loss of $5. When she returned the $15 in change to the man, she incurred an additional loss of $15. So in total, she lost $20, plus the $5 bottle of perfume that she sold. Therefore, the correct loss is "Fifteen dollars plus the perfume."

Question  6
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to cling to, so even though it was soaked, its skin remained dry. This is a clever play on words in the question, as it implies that the cat's hair did not get wet, but in reality, the lack of hair is the reason it stayed dry.
Question: Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He was tired, and he realized that he had to spend all money to rest in hotel.', "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.", 'The man was pushing his car because it had run out of gas.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee." This is the correct answer because the scenario described matches a situation in the game Monopoly where a player may go bankrupt if they land on a space with a hotel and do not have enough money to pay the fee. The other answer choices do not align with the given scenario of a man pushing his vehicle and realizing he is bankrupt upon arriving at a hotel.
Question: An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case? Choose the best answer choice.

Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The correct answer is "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This is the best answer because it provides a logical explanation for the scenario described. It plays on the double meaning of the words "shoot," "submerged," and "hung," implying that the woman was not actually harming her spouse but instead taking a photograph and developing it as a photographer would do. This clever play on words provides a plausible explanation for the seemingly contradictory events.

Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any fur for the rain to soak into, so even though it got completely wet, its hairless skin remained dry. This explanation directly addresses the impossible situation of a cat getting completely wet while not a single hair was wet.

Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even though it was caught in a downpour, it would not have any wet hair. This explanation fits the scenario perfectly and is the most logical reason for a cat to not have wet hair despite being caught in heavy rain.
Question: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The temperature of the steel ball is more consistent with water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit." This is because the density of water changes with temperature, and at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water would be denser than at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This would cause the steel ball to fall more rapidly through the denser water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Question  8
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." In an orphanage school, the teacher may assume the role of a parent or guardian and may have the authority to discipline the children without objections from parents. In this setting, the teacher has the responsibility to enforce discipline and may not require consent from parents for disciplinary actions. This explains why not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class.
Question: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were in the middle of desert.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'The two camels were facing each other the entire time.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time." This is because when two objects are facing in opposite directions, they are actually facing towards each other. For example, if one camel is facing due East and the other camel is facing due West, they are essentially facing each other despite the opposite directions. This means that they can see each other without needing to move around or turn their heads. Therefore, they were facing each other the entire time.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is the correct answer because the lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane, and a swimmer walking in the shallow end would not be considered a safety infraction within the designated one-way swimming lane. Therefore, the lifeguards did not take action because there was no violation taking place.
Question: In Jamaica, some kids can stand on the water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, how is that possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The water in Jamaica is not dirty', 'Kids in Jamaica have lower density than water.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." At such a low temperature, the water would be frozen, allowing kids to stand on it. This is possible because the water has turned into solid ice due to the cold temperature, providing a stable surface for standing. The other answer choices are not relevant to the specific conditions described in the question.

Question  10
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense." This is because the term "doctor" can also refer to someone who has obtained a doctorate degree in a non-medical field, such as a Ph.D. Therefore, the woman's sons could be doctors in a different academic discipline, such as psychology, engineering, or philosophy, without having attended medical school. This explanation fits the given scenario of the four boys being doctors without attending medical school.
Question: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 20 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.', 'The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice." This is because at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water freezes and becomes solid ice, which would prevent the steel ball from falling through it. Therefore, it is not possible for the steel ball to fall through water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit in Jamaica. This explanation is supported by the physical properties of water at different temperatures and the behavior of materials at those temperatures.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He lives in Alaska and sunrises are every six months." This is the correct answer because in certain parts of Alaska, particularly in the northern regions, the phenomenon of "polar night" occurs where the sun does not rise for several months during the winter. Therefore, the boy could have stayed out all night and arrived home with a full-grown beard before the next sunrise. This is a unique and specific circumstance that explains how he could have arrived home with a beard despite his parents' instructions.

Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." The lifeguards did not take action because the individual was not actually swimming in the wrong direction, but rather walking in the shallow end of the pool. Therefore, there was no safety infraction to address in this situation.
Question: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The bagger's brother is a murderer.", 'The man is angry for his brother being a beggar and cut ties with him.', "The beggar was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The beggar was the man's sister."
This is because the statement "A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother" is a play on words. The beggar is actually a female, and she is referred to as a "beggar's brother" to lead the reader to assume it is a male. In reality, the beggar is the man's sister, so when it is said that "the man who died had no brother", it is true because the man only had a sister.

Question  15
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air."

This is the correct answer because by continuously juggling the silver spheres while crossing the bridge, Robert never had all five spheres on the bridge at the same time, effectively reducing the total weight on the bridge to below the maximum limit of 90 kilograms. This allowed him to securely cross the bridge with all his treasures without exceeding the weight limit.
Question: There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert.

Answer Choices: ['The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions.', 'Their eyes have a very wide view.', 'They were in the middle of desert.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions." This is the correct answer because two camels facing in opposite directions will still be able to see each other without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around. Since they are facing each other, their lines of sight intersect and they are able to see each other without any additional movement.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is the correct answer because the man's actions were not seen as suspicious by the store staff or customers, and no one stopped him or called the police. As an employee, he would have been allowed to leave the store with the items in the cart because he was taking out trash, and his actions would have been considered normal. This explanation fits with the situation presented in the question and provides a logical reason for why the man was able to leave the store without paying.
Question: Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper." This is the correct answer because Dorothy's behavior of going to a high location and jumping without being injured indicates that she has experience and skill in sky jumping. Since she feels better afterwards and has never been hurt, it suggests that she is engaging in this activity intentionally, rather than with the intent to harm herself. This explanation aligns with her behavior and the lack of negative outcomes from her jumps.

Question  18
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, it would have reached a certain height and then started to descend back towards the ground. At this point, the force of gravity would act on the ball, causing it to fall back towards the boy. Therefore, by kicking the ball up, it would have traveled a distance of 10 feet and then returned to him. This explanation accounts for the miraculous return of the ball after being kicked.
Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain? Choose the correct answer choice.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He lived in a light house." This is because a light house is a tall building with a powerful light at the top, designed to guide and warn ships at sea. Therefore, it would be expected for a light house to have a very bright light on at night, and the neighbors wouldn't complain because it is a normal and necessary part of living near a light house.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain. Despite being completely soaked by the downpour, a hairless cat would not have a single hair to become wet. Therefore, the cat could be completely dry even after being exposed to heavy rain.

Question  20
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is the correct answer because the logical noticed that the first barber's hair was poorly cut and he needed a shave, suggesting that the second barber had given him a bad haircut. In contrast, the second barber had a well-kept appearance, indicating that the first barber had given him a good haircut. Therefore, the logical chose to get his haircut at the first place he went based on this reasoning.
Question: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is because when someone is on a bridge and sees a train approaching, they must first run in the direction of the train in order to reach a point where they can safely jump off the track. If they were to jump off the track immediately, they would risk landing on the ground below the bridge or not having enough time to clear the tracks. Therefore, the man charged at the train for a short distance before getting off the track in order to ensure his safety.

Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the young boy kicked the soccer ball up into the air, the force of the kick propelled the ball to a height of 10 feet. After reaching its peak height, gravity caused the ball to start falling back towards the ground, and it miraculously returned to the boy. This is the correct answer because it explains how the ball traveled 10 feet and then returned to the boy, without relying on external forces like the wind or a rope.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any hair to get wet from the rain, so even though it was completely soaked, its hairless skin would not show any signs of being wet.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is because as a skilled juggler, Robert was able to keep one silver sphere in the air at all times, reducing his effective weight to 71 kilograms and allowing him to safely cross the bridge within its weight limit. This solution creatively utilizes Robert's circus skills to overcome the weight restriction of the bridge.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman is a surrogate mother." This is because a surrogate mother carries a child or children for another individual or couple and gives birth to them, but is not biologically related to the children. Therefore, she can legally give birth to five children without ever being pregnant with them herself. This explanation aligns with the given information and makes logical sense in the context of the question.

The use of the word "shoot" can be interpreted in different ways, and in this context, it refers to taking photographs. Therefore, no one was killed or injured because the woman was not actually shooting at people with a firearm.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the youngster kicks the soccer ball up into the air with enough force, it will travel a certain distance before gravity causes it to fall back to the ground. The angle and force of the kick determine the distance the ball travels before returning. This explains how the youngster could kick the ball 10 feet and have it miraculously return to him.

Question  27
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because the stones were not actually stones, but rather cherry seeds. Cherry seeds are often referred to as "stones," so the other farmer was not harmed by the throw. The use of the term "stones" in this context is a play on words, tricking the reader into assuming they were actual stones.
Question: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He's a professional sprinter.", 'He is afraid others will laugh at him.', 'He tries to be friendly.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He's a professional sprinter" because the nickname "Lightning" likely refers to his speed and agility on the track. Despite his fear of storms and disinterest in meteorology, he is delighted by the nickname because it reflects his prowess as a sprinter. This explanation aligns with the given information and provides a logical reason for his delight in being called "Lightning."

Question  28
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is, "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." The horse was able to reach the food because there was no restriction from the rope. The length of the rope does not impact the horse's ability to reach the food since it was not tied to anything, allowing the horse to move freely without any constraints. Therefore, the horse used a straight path to get to the food without the need for the rope to stretch or any other external factors.
Question: I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['I am oxygen.', 'I am sound.', 'I am sunshine.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "I am oxygen" because oxygen is necessary for life, yet it can also cause destruction. It breaks down walls and corrodes steel through the process of oxidation, but it is essential for the sustenance of all living organisms. People desire oxygen to breathe and sustain life, but they fear its uncontrolled presence in the form of fire or pollution. Therefore, oxygen fits all the characteristics mentioned in the question.

Question  29
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is because it is a classic paradox known as the "barber paradox." The logical couldn't have chosen the first barber because of his messy appearance, and since the second barber was well-groomed, the only logical explanation is that they must have cut each other's hair. This creates a paradox because it is impossible for either barber to be the one who shaves the barber who shaves himself.
Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." This is possible because there is no mention of the rope being tied to anything, so it is assumed that the rope is simply attached to the horse. As long as the horse can move freely within the five-meter radius, it can reach the hay without breaking the rope. The length of the rope in this scenario is irrelevant, as the horse can move within the radius to reach the hay. Therefore, there is no need for the rope to stretch or for the saloon walls to retract.

Question  30
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense." This means that they hold doctorate degrees in fields other than medicine, such as history, philosophy, or physics. Therefore, despite being referred to as doctors, they did not attend medical school. This answer clears up the apparent contradiction by providing an alternative interpretation of the term "doctors."
Question: A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['\nThey can wait until the water evaporates completely.', 'They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.', 'They can wait until water level is high enough, they can safely step out onto the shoreline. ', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland." The boat is only one meter from the shore, so the men can simply step out of the boat and walk onto the shore. They don't need to worry about being submerged, drowning, or encountering sharks because the water is shallow and close to the shore. Therefore, they can reach the coast without any danger or difficulty.
Question: Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It is a spaceship.', 'The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses.', 'There are reflection on the island.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The correct answer is "The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses." Since the lighthouses are back to back and facing in opposite directions, they can both shine their light on the ship at the same time when the ship is positioned directly between them. This allows both lighthouses to illuminate the ship simultaneously, despite facing different directions.

Question  31
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the youngster kicks the ball up into the air, it reaches a certain height and then starts to fall back down due to gravity. If kicked with enough force, the ball can return close to its starting point, appearing as if it miraculously returned to the youngster. The force of the kick and the angle at which it was kicked will determine how far the ball travels before returning. Therefore, kicking the ball up is the most likely explanation for how it miraculously returned to the youngster.
Question: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Cafe.', 'Bakery.', 'Clock store.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Clock store." Emily doesn't know what time it is, so she must go into a place that can provide her with the time, and a clock store is the most likely place for her to find a clock and therefore the correct time. A cafe or a bakery wouldn't necessarily have a visible clock, and it is unlikely that Emily would need to go inside to find out the time. Therefore, she must be outside a clock store.
Question: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Cafe.', 'Bakery.', 'Clock store.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Clock store." This is because a clock store is the most logical place for Emily to find out the time. While a cafe or bakery may have a clock inside, it is not guaranteed, and it is unlikely that Emily would need to go inside to find out the time in those places. Therefore, the best answer is the clock store.

Question  32
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." This is because if the rope is not tied to anything, then it doesn't limit the horse's movement and the horse can simply walk directly to the food without being restricted by the length of the rope. The other answer choices involve stretching the rope, retracting walls, or other unrealistic scenarios that do not logically address the situation described in the question.
Question: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.", 'There was a one-week long holidays.', 'He fiies straightly for 24 hours and flies quickly for the hours left.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday." This is because the question is not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a play on words. By naming the airplane "Tuesday," it can "take off" in Los Angeles on Tuesday, "fly" for 48 hours, and then "land" in Tokyo on Tuesday, without violating the laws of time and physics. This answer does not require any extraordinary feats or time travel, making it the most plausible explanation.

Question  33
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver of the large black car with no lights on was able to see the man dressed in all black because it was day time, and there was enough natural light for the driver to see him. This explains how the car's driver knew he was there.
Question: A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was during the daylight hours.', 'The driver could have relied on their sense of hearing to detect the presence of the dog.', "The broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it's dim. ", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was during the daylight hours." This is because the scenario mentions that the dog was standing in the intersection in a town that is painted black, and none of the street lights were working due to a power failure caused by a storm. This implies that it was during the daylight hours when there was still natural light available for the driver to see the black dog in time to avoid hitting it. This explanation is supported by the details provided in the scenario.

Question  34
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died." This is the correct answer because if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, it is highly likely that they would have died from starvation. The other options do not provide a realistic or logical way to survive the deadly situations behind the doors.
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the correct answer choice.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died." Although the situation seems impossible, the premise of the scenario is that the lions have not eaten in 5 years, making it highly unlikely that they would still be alive. The other doors have immediate and certain ways to die (fire and lava, 1,000-foot drop into an alligator), whereas the second door offers the possibility of survival.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense" because they are likely to have earned doctorate degrees in disciplines other than medicine. In academic terms, a doctorate degree confers the title of "doctor," and it is possible for someone to be called a doctor without having studied medicine. This scenario explains how the sons are all doctors without having attended medical school.
Question: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.', 'He uses a computer to compute his actions.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun." By hanging his hat on the barrel, he was able to walk the 100 yards, turn around, and shoot the bullet through the hat because the hat was already in line with the gun's barrel. His blindfolded state did not affect his ability to aim because the hat provided the necessary alignment for the shot. This explanation is the only logical and feasible solution to how the sharpshooter achieved the feat.

Question  36
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, it reached a certain height and then started to fall back toward the ground. Due to the force of his kick, the ball traveled approximately 10 feet horizontally before gravity caused it to descend back toward the ground, ultimately landing near the boy. This created the illusion that the ball miraculously returned to him. The other answer choices, such as the wind or a rope, do not provide a plausible explanation for how the ball could have returned to the boy after being kicked.
Question: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Dprpyju was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Dorothy is a sky jumper.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Dorothy is a sky jumper." This is because her behavior of regularly visiting a high spot and jumping from it without experiencing injury or expressing suicidal thoughts suggests that she is likely engaging in a form of extreme sports or skydiving. Her actions may be a way for her to experience an adrenaline rush and feel a sense of exhilaration, rather than a manifestation of suicidal tendencies. Additionally, her statement that she feels much better afterward supports the idea that she is intentionally seeking out this activity for a positive physical and emotional experience.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." This is because the man dressed in all black would have been visible to the car's driver due to daylight, even if the car had no lights on. The driver would have been able to see him without needing to rely on paying attention, listening, or any other factors.
Question: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible? Choose the correct answer choice.

He accidentally excluding February 29th on a leap year\'s calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He lived in a lighthouse." This is because a lighthouse is a structure equipped with a powerful light that is used as a navigational aid for ships at sea. It has nothing to do with sleepwalking or botany. Therefore, the man could have turned off the light in the lighthouse before going to bed, leading to the darkness potentially causing harm to ships, which indirectly resulted in the deaths of 365 people.

Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver was able to see the man dressed in all black because it was day time, and the car's headlights were not the only source of visibility. At day time, the driver would have been able to see the man even without the use of headlights. This explanation aligns with the given scenario and does not rely on assumptions about the driver's attention or listening skills.

Answer Choices: ['Some daughters get married and have their own family.', 'Each daughter shares the same brother.', 'Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each daughter shares the same brother." This is possible because all six daughters have the same brother, meaning that there is only one brother in the family. Therefore, the total number of family members is 1 (brother) + 6 (daughters) + 2 (parents) = 9, which satisfies the given information. This solution maintains the given information that each daughter has one brother while also accounting for the total number of family members.

Question  40
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." The lifeguards didn't take action because the person was not actually violating the one-way swimming lane rule by swimming in the wrong direction. Instead, they were walking in the shallow end of the pool, which does not constitute a safety infraction in this context. Therefore, the lifeguards did not need to take any action.
Question: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman gets arrested for murder after dinner.', 'The woman gets a new partner.', 'The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry." This answer makes sense because it explains the seemingly violent actions in a non-literal way. The woman didn't actually shoot, drown, or hang her husband, but instead, she performed these actions as part of her photography process. This solution aligns with the logic of the given scenario and resolves the apparent contradiction.

Question  41
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the youngster kicks the soccer ball up into the air with enough force, it will travel a certain distance before reaching its peak height and then start to come back down. The force of the initial kick combined with the downward force of gravity causes the ball to return to the boy after traveling a distance of 10 feet. This is a simple concept of physics and projectile motion.
Question: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately." This is the correct answer because being on a bridge would have restricted the man's ability to jump off the track immediately when he first saw the train. It explains why he charged towards the oncoming train for a short distance before finally jumping off the track. This answer takes into consideration the specific circumstances of the situation and provides a logical explanation for the man's actions.

Answer Choices: ["By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train.', "The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed." This is the best answer because it takes into account the psychological and physiological response of the man's brain to the approaching train. As the man moves towards the train, the change in distance and relative motion may create the perception of a decrease in speed, leading the man to believe he has more time to react before jumping off the track. This answer considers the human factor and provides a plausible explanation for the man's behavior.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver of the car could see the man dressed in all black walking down the country lane because it was daytime, allowing for visibility even without the car's lights on. This explanation is the most straightforward and logical reason for how the car's driver knew the man was there.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current.

Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." When a river becomes too narrow for a kayak to pass through, deflating the kayak slightly will make it more flexible and easier to maneuver through the tight space. This suggestion addresses the specific problem Mary is facing and provides a practical solution to help her continue her paddle.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." This is because in an orphanage school, the children typically do not have parents to object to disciplinary measures, so it is possible that not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class.
Question: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He receives technological assistance stealthy.', 'He uses the sound to feel the direction.', 'Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane." This is the correct answer because it is the only explanation that logically allows the pilot to fly through the ring without any technological assistance or help from others. By attaching the ring to the front of the plane before putting on the blindfold, the pilot can simply fly straight ahead and through the ring without needing to see it. This solution aligns with the given scenario and does not require any outside assistance or reliance on sound to feel the direction.

Question  44
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver was able to see the man dressed in all black because it was day time, and not because the driver was paying much attention or was good at listening. In the daylight, even a person dressed in all black would be visible to the driver, allowing them to stop the car in time.
Question: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "By moving towards the oncoming bear, the woman's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.", 'By moving towards the bear momentarily, the woman minimizes the risk of being catch by the bear.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This is the correct answer because if the woman was on a narrow mountain path and saw a fast-approaching bear, she may not have had the space or time to step off the path immediately due to being on a cliff edge. This could have forced her to sprint towards the bear for a short distance before being able to step off the path. The other answer choices do not provide a logical reason for the woman's behavior in the given scenario.

Question: Emma was making a peach cobbler. After peeling and chopping all the peaches, she realized that she had to add a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches. How did she figure out how much cinnamon to add? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['She is an execellent chef.', 'She is good at physicis.', 'She counted the peach pits.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "She counted the peach pits." When Emma realized she needed to add a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches, she likely used the peach pits to count how many peaches she had chopped. By counting the pits, she would know exactly how many peaches she had and could then determine how much cinnamon to add. This method allowed her to accurately measure the amount of cinnamon needed for the peach cobbler recipe.

Question  46
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the correct answer because as a circus performer who has mastered juggling, Robert can keep one silver sphere in the air at all times, ensuring that the total weight on the bridge never exceeds the maximum limit of 90 kilograms. This allows him to safely cross the bridge with all his treasures.

Question  47
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is because the logical decided to go to the first barber after observing that the second barber had recently had his hair cut and was impeccably dressed, suggesting that the first barber must have given him a better haircut. This implies that the first barber must be more skilled, which is why the logical chose to get his haircut there despite the initial appearance of the shop.

Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because the stones thrown by the farmer were actually cherry seeds, which are commonly referred to as "stones." Therefore, they were not actual stones and would not cause harm in the way that ordinary stones would. This explanation is supported by the fact that the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the "stones."

This explanation aligns with the information given in the question and provides a plausible reason for the scenario.
Question: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.', 'The rope is not tied to anything else.', 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope is not tied to anything else." The key to solving this riddle is to question the assumption that the rope is tied to something. In reality, the horse is simply attached to a free-standing rope, allowing it to move around freely within the five-meter radius without being restricted by any other object. This creates the illusion that the horse is confined to a specific area when in fact it has the ability to reach the hay ten meters away. Therefore, the horse can easily access the hay without any limitations imposed by the rope.

Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." This is the correct answer because in an orphanage school, there are no parents to object to the disciplining of the children. Since the children are all orphans, there are no parents to inform in advance or to object to the disciplinary actions taken by the teacher. Therefore, it makes sense that not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class.
Question: A couple is having a disagreement over the man's error. The man kept apologizing and pleading with the woman to allow him to see her directly. The woman was still upset. Thus, she wouldn't agree. The couple, though, was positioned on the same mat. How is that even doable? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The mat was folded in multiple times and end up with a special shape.', 'The woman kept turning her back to the man.', "The couple was standing on two sides of the girl's apartment door, which had a rug under it.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "The couple was standing on two sides of the girl's apartment door, which had a rug under it." This is the correct answer because it explains how the couple could be on the same mat while still being in disagreement. The man was on one side of the door, on the mat, pleading with the woman who was on the other side of the door, also on the mat. This scenario allows for the couple to be physically positioned on the same mat but still unable to see each other directly, representing their disagreement.

Question  53
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is because the scenario explains that the man was filling a shopping cart, not a basket, with items, which is unusual for a regular shopper. Additionally, the fact that no one stopped him or called the police indicates that his actions were not seen as theft. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the man was an employee using the cart to dispose of trash.
Question: A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', "The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck." The bridge can support the weight of the truck, and the vehicle has driven halfway across the bridge, meaning it has used up half of its fuel. Therefore, the weight of the truck on the bridge is now less than the bridge's weight capacity, preventing it from collapsing. The bird landing on the bridge is just a distraction and not the true reason for the bridge not collapsing.
Question: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The farmer's farm did not have suitable conditions for growing radishes.", 'There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.', "Radishes don't grow during the current season.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning." This is because the absence of dew on the radishes indicates that they were not freshly harvested that morning, contradicting the farmer's claim. This contradiction led to his detention by the police.

Question  54
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is because the situation described does not actually involve a safety infraction in the swimming lane. The lifeguards did not take action because the swimmer was not swimming in the wrong direction but rather walking in the shallow end, which would not be a violation of the one-way swimming lane.
Question: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The restaurant is too expensive.', 'They found money in their hamburger.', 'Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day." because the question states that Wednesday, Tom, and Joe had dinner, which suggests that Wednesday is a person's name rather than the day of the week. This implies that Wednesday is the one who paid the bill, as it says "they paid" and "Joe and Tom don't have to pay." Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Wednesday, the third person in the group, paid the bill.

Question  55
Question: Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The bird.', 'The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "None of above." None of the animals mentioned - the monkey, squirrel, and bird - are capable of grabbing the banana first because coconuts do not grow on banana trees. It is important to carefully consider the information provided in the question before making assumptions. In this case, the type of tree is crucial to determining the correct answer.
Question: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl. Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Owl.', 'Tiger.', 'Bat.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "None of above." While it is commonly believed that owls can see in total darkness, none of the options provided would see most clearly in total darkness. In reality, no animal can see in total darkness. However, some animals like bats and owls have developed adaptations such as echolocation and highly sensitive vision to help them navigate and hunt in low-light conditions, but they still need some level of light to see clearly.

Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "None of above." While owls and bats have adaptations that allow them to see in low-light conditions, no animal can see clearly in total darkness. It is important to carefully consider the capabilities of each animal before making assumptions about their abilities.

Question  56
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." because the man was dressed in all black, making him visible against the light background of the country lane during the day. The driver would have been able to see him even without lights on the car, making it unnecessary for the driver to have been paying much attention or being good at listening for the car to stop. Thus, the visibility of the man due to daytime is the most plausible explanation.
Question: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." The magician could have filled the glass with a substance that looks like water, such as clear gel or fake water, that does not spill easily when dropped. This trick deceives the audience into thinking that the glass was filled with water when in fact it was not, thus preventing any spillage.

Question  57
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." This is because when the boy kicks the soccer ball up into the air with enough force, it will reach a certain height and then start to fall back towards the ground. If he kicks it high enough, the ball will come back to him, hence the miraculous return. This is a common technique used in soccer to practice ball control and timing.
Question: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['People are getting used to it.', 'It is a culture traditional.', 'Morgan is the name of hurricane.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Morgan is the name of hurricane." This is because the prompt suggests that Morgan is not a person but a hurricane, so it would not make sense for people to feel sad about the death of a hurricane. The confusion may have arisen from the use of the name "Morgan," which is typically associated with a person, leading people to assume it was about a person dying. However, in this context, it refers to the hurricane.

Question  58
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The stones were actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the correct answer because it explains why the other farmer received no harm at all despite being hit by the stones. Since the "stones" were actually seeds, they lacked the force and hardness to cause any significant injury. This unexpected twist challenges our preconceptions about the situation and provides a logical explanation for the outcome.
Question: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Matthew is a deep-sea diver.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'Matthew was just raving to show her is outstanding.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Matthew is a deep-sea diver." This is the correct answer because it explains why he repeatedly goes to a deep spot and plunges into the profound depth. As a deep-sea diver, he is trained and skilled in navigating such environments, which is why he has not been injured or killed as a result of his actions. This career choice also explains why he feels better afterwards - diving is his passion and a source of stress relief.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is because as an employee, he would have permission to take items out of the store without paying, and his purpose for taking the items is legitimate. Additionally, the other options do not provide a valid explanation for why the man would be allowed to leave without paying for the items.

Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat does not have any fur to get wet, so even though it was caught in the rain, it would not have been able to get soaked. This is the most logical explanation for the cat not getting wet despite being caught in a downpour.
Question: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew." This is the correct answer because the rose bush that was the wife would not have dew on it, since it had been inside the house overnight. The husband was able to identify his wife by noticing the absence of dew on her particular rose bush.

Question  61
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." The horse could simply walk directly to the food because the rope was not attached to anything, allowing him to reach the food without any restrictions. The length of the rope is irrelevant in this scenario because it is not tied to anything, so it does not limit the horse's movement. Therefore, the horse did not need to use any specific path to reach the food.
Question: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." because penguins do not inhabit the Arctic region where the natives live. Therefore, it is not possible for the natives to come across or consider eating penguin eggs since they do not reside in the same geographical area. This eliminates the possibility of penguins and their eggs being part of the natives' traditional or cultural diet.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is because the stones mentioned in the story were actually seeds, not hard and heavy stones. Cherry seeds are called stones, and they are not capable of causing harm or injury like normal stones would. This is a playful way of misleading the reader and challenging their preconceptions about the nature of the stones.
Question: A man uses the elevator since he is too old to use his crutch to ascend to the 12th floor. He is asked to hit the 17th button by a woman who is taller than him because she is unable to do it herself. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch.', 'The old man was granted exclusive access to the higher floors.', 'The woman thinks pressing the 17th button in the elevator brings good luck or wards off bad luck.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch." The woman is taller than the old man, but she is unable to press the button herself, so it's likely that the button is higher than she can reach. Since the old man uses a crutch, he can extend his reach with it and press the button for the woman. This scenario does not indicate anything about luck or exclusive access, so the correct answer is about the old man's ability to reach the button with his crutch.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." In a doubles match, two players form a team and compete against another team. Each team member's wins contribute to the overall team score, so it's possible for both men to win three sets each, resulting in a tie. This is a common occurrence in doubles tennis matches.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "None of the above." The monkey, squirrel, and bird are all known for their ability to climb trees, but coconuts typically grow at the top of the tree, which the monkey, squirrel, and bird may not be able to reach. Therefore, none of the animals would be able to grab the banana first as it is out of reach for all of them.

Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." The lifeguards didn't take action because the swimmer was not actually violating the one-way swimming lane rule at that moment. Since the swimmer was walking in the shallow end, they were not actually swimming in the wrong direction. Therefore, the lifeguards did not need to intervene.
Question: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a criminal and too ashamed to admit he has a police brother.', "The police's brother is a murderer.", "The police was the man's sister.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The police was the man's sister." This is possible because the police officer could be a woman, making her the deceased man's sister. This scenario would explain the statement that the "brother" of a police passed away, even though the dead man actually had no brother. This requires us to challenge the assumption that the police officer is male, and consider the possibility of the police officer being female.

Question  66
Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense." In this context, the term "doctors" refers to individuals who hold a PhD or other advanced academic degrees, not medical doctors. Therefore, it is possible for the woman's sons to be doctors without having attended medical school. This answer reflects a nuanced understanding of the term "doctor" and the different fields in which it can be applied.
Question: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He positioned himself.', 'He stood on a block of ice until it melted.', 'The man sat on the floor.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He stood on a block of ice until it melted." This is because the man stood on the block of ice, put the noose around his neck, and then waited for the ice to melt, causing him to hang. The paddle of water on the floor was the remnants of the melted ice. This explanation fits the given scenario and provides a logical solution to the mystery.

Question  67
Question: In a small town, a logical with some free time made the decision to get a haircut. There were only two barbers in the town, and they each had a shop. The rational glance into one store revealed that it was incredibly expensive. His clothes were messy, his hair was poorly cut, and the barber needed to shave. The other store was very well-kept. The barber had recently had his hair cut and was immaculately dressed. Why did the logical get his haircut at the first place he went? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The logician chose the first barber because he believed the untidy appearance suggested that the barber was so busy.', "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut.", 'The logician went to the first barber because he felt sympathy for him.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is because we can infer from the information given that the barbers must have cut each other's hair, leading to the second barber having a well-kept appearance and a good haircut. The logician's decision to go to the first barber suggests that he noticed the second barber's well-kept appearance and inferred that the first barber must have given the second barber a better haircut, demonstrating his skill.
Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'There are too many fish around the ship.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a Submarine." Submarines have the capability to sink and surface without being crushed, as they are designed to control their buoyancy. The statement "each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening" suggests that the sinking was intentional and part of the submarine's normal operations, which would not be the case for a regular ship. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that the "ship" in question is actually a submarine.

Question  69
Question: A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." The driver was able to see the man dressed in all black because it was daytime, and he was visible despite the lack of lights on the car. The driver's ability to see the man was based on the natural light of the day, not on his attentiveness or listening skills.
Question: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.', 'He told she to overturn the kayak.', 'He suggested that she expand the river slightly.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly." This is the correct answer because by deflating the kayak slightly, Mary would be able to make it through the narrow passage. This would make the kayak narrower and more flexible, allowing it to pass through the tight space. The other options of overturning the kayak or expanding the river are not feasible solutions to the problem at hand. Therefore, deflating the kayak slightly is the most practical and effective suggestion.
Question: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison was in the ice.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison need time to dissolve.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "The poison was in the ice." This is the best answer because it explains why only Maria perished despite both of them drinking the same drinks. The poison being in the ice would mean that as Maria drank her drink and the ice melted, she would have ingested the poison, leading to her demise. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why only Maria perished despite both of them drinking the same drinks. Therefore, the poison being in the ice is the most plausible explanation.

Question  70
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is because the lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane, not the shallow end where walking is permitted. Since the swimmer was not actually swimming in the designated lane, there was no safety infraction for the lifeguards to address. Therefore, they did not take any action.

Question  71
Question: Two lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane in a public pool, watching for any safety infractions. They see a swimmer moving in the wrong direction but they don't take action. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The swimmer tried to get away from the lifeguards.', 'There was no people on that lane so the violation is permiteed.', "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is because the lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane, and if the swimmer is walking in the shallow end, they are not actually in violation of the one-way rule for swimming. Therefore, the lifeguards would not take action in this scenario.
Question: Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['They were little children and were scared to death by the sound of breaking glass.', 'The water in the glass was at an extremely low temperature that two people got cold.', 'The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke." This is the correct answer because the presence of water and shattered glass indicates a fishbowl breaking, leading to the demise of the goldfish. There is no indication of children being present, nor does the scenario involve low temperature water causing harm to people. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the bodies are goldfish from a broken fishbowl.
Question: A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery.

Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Because the doctor is the mother of the son." This answer challenges the traditional gender roles and assumptions about who can be a doctor, highlighting that the doctor in the scenario is the boy's mother. This is a classic example of gender bias and challenges the assumption that a doctor is always male.

Answer Choices: ['The 24th president has better performance during tenure.', 'Their parents got divorced.', 'They were the same man.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "They were the same man." This may seem inconceivable, but it is a historical fact that Grover Cleveland served as both the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, making him the only president to have served non-consecutive terms.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each barber must have cut the other's hair. The logical picked the barber who had given his rival the better haircut." This is because the logical assumed that since each barber had cut the other's hair, the better-looking haircut must have been done by the untidy barber, making him the better barber. This demonstrates the logical's reasoning and decision-making process based on observation and deduction.
Question: A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater. How will she survive? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The woman should use the fishing rod to hook onto a passing plane or a bird flying high in the sky, which will then whisk her away to safety.', 'The woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking.', 'As the situation is pretty urgent, the woman has no choice but to eat the backpack and fishing rod directly for energy.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is that the woman has to use the fishing rod to catch birds or other wildlife and use the backpack to collect rainwater for drinking. This is the correct answer because it addresses both the need for food and water in a practical way given the resources available to her on the isolated island. Using the fishing rod for catching birds or other wildlife provides a source of food, while the backpack can be used to collect rainwater, ensuring she has access to clean drinking water for survival.

Answer Choices: ['The girl has two mothers.', "The gril's mother gets a promotion.", "The secretary was the girl's father.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The secretary was the girl's father." This is because the bank manager and the secretary are different people, so the secretary could have his own daughter. The statement made by the secretary is not contradictory because there was no information given about the bank manager being the girl's father. Therefore, the secretary could indeed be the girl's father.

Question  76
Question: A horse was tethered to a 5 meter long rope, and the horse's food was 15 meters distant. What path did the horse use to get to the food? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food.", 'The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay fifteen meters away.', 'The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the food.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything, so he could reach the food." This is because if the rope wasn't tied to anything, then the horse would have been free to move around and reach the food. Tethering the horse to a rope without tying it to anything means that the horse can move within the full 15-meter radius, unhindered by the length of the rope. Therefore, the horse would have used a direct path to reach the food without any constraints.
Question: A man gives a woman a $10 bill and pays her $3 for a rope. To get change, the woman enters the grocery store right next door. When she comes back, she gives the man $7. Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me, the store clerk says as the customer leaves. The lady hands the cashier a decent bill. How much has she lost in total? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Seven dollars plus the rope.', 'Thirteen dollars.', 'Seven dollars.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Seven dollars plus the rope" because the woman initially received a counterfeit $10 bill from the man, so she lost $10 in that transaction. Then, she paid $3 for the rope, so that adds to her loss. When she went to the grocery store, she gave the cashier the counterfeit bill and got $7 in change, but she also had to give the cashier a decent bill. Therefore, she lost the $10 from the counterfeit bill, the $3 for the rope, and the $7 change she received, which adds up to a total loss of $20.

Question  77
Question: A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The man is a sleepwalker.', 'The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.', 'All the items in the shopping cart are cheap.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is because the scenario describes a situation where no one stops the man or calls the police, indicating that his actions are not perceived as theft. Additionally, the fact that he is in a grocery store and filling a cart with items suggests that he is performing a typical task within the store, such as restocking or taking out trash. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that he is an employee carrying out his job duties.
Question: A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["He never ruin clothes before. His heart couldn't handle the stress, leading to his unfortunate demise.", 'He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.', "His suit was so expensive that he couldn't  afford to buy a new one.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs." because in the context of the question, the most logical explanation for the man's death after his suit was torn is that he was in the vacuum of space without proper protection. Without a functional suit, he would have been exposed to the extreme conditions of space, resulting in his demise. This explanation aligns with the details provided in the question and is the most plausible reason for his sudden death.

Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
Correct Answer: The best answer is "He was the star baseball player." This is because the question implies that the man is called "Batman" by others, and the most logical reason for this is that he excels at playing baseball and is known for his batting skills, leading to the nickname "Batman." This aligns with the idea that he still loves being called "Batman" despite not having any interest in actual bats, as the nickname is likely a reflection of his athletic abilities.

Question  78
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is the second door with the lions because the lions would have likely died from starvation after not eating for 5 years, making it safe to enter. The other two options still pose a threat as the fire and lava in the first door and the alligator in the third door are both still active dangers. Therefore, the second door with the lions is the most likely to result in survival.
Question: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The intense weather conditions flood the marina.', 'The boat is towed by police.', "The station wasn't fixed in the marina", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The station wasn't fixed in the marina." This is because if the station wasn't properly fixed in the marina, it could have come loose, allowing the boat to drift away into the ocean. The boat being tied to an unstable or unsecured station would explain how the owner found it in the middle of the ocean a couple of hours later.

Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is the correct answer because as a proficient circus performer, Robert can juggle the five silver spheres, ensuring that only one sphere is in the air at any given time, thereby keeping his weight on the bridge under the 90 kg limit. This solution allows Robert to safely cross the rickety old bridge with all his treasures.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Because the teacher is the mother of the Tom." This is the correct answer because it explains why the teacher cannot supervise Tom during the exam. It is a common practice for a parent not to supervise their own child during an exam to avoid any potential conflicts of interest or favoritism. This situation aligns with that practice, as the teacher is Tom's mother, so she cannot supervise him during the exam.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is because the lifeguards were monitoring a one-way swimming lane, and if the swimmer was walking in the shallow end, they were not violating the one-way rule. It's important for the lifeguards to accurately assess the situation and only take action when necessary to ensure safety in the pool.
Question: Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The poison need time to dissolve.', 'The poison is unfunctional when you drink them together.', 'The poison was in the ice.', 'None of above.']

Juliana drank her drinks quickly and did not give the ice enough time to melt, whereas Maria drank her drink more slowly, allowing the ice to melt and release the poison into her drink. Therefore, the ice was the source of the poison that ultimately caused Maria's death.

Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat" because without any hair to absorb the rain, the cat would have remained dry despite being caught in a downpour. This explanation aligns with the fact that the cat got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the cat must have been hairless.

Question  85
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." In an orphanage school, it is likely that the children do not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach of the teacher. Therefore, the absence of parental objection can be explained by the unique circumstances of the school, rather than the teacher informing parents or children in advance about the disciplinary approach.
Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['He told Danny to left the bridge.', 'He told Danny to overturn the track.', 'He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He told Danny to let some air out of his tires." By letting some air out of the tires, the overall height of the semi would decrease, allowing Danny to carefully maneuver the truck out from underneath the bridge. This simple solution would effectively create the necessary clearance for the semi to safely exit without causing damage to the truck or the overpass.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." In an orphanage school, the children may not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach, which could include spanking.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is, "The swimmer wasn't swimming at the time, he was just walking in the shallow end of the pool." This is because the lifeguards are monitoring a one-way swimming lane, and if the swimmer was walking in the shallow end of the pool, they were not in violation of the one-way swimming rule. Therefore, the lifeguards did not take action because there was no safety infraction occurring at that time.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car." This is possible because the statement "all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue" means that one car must be both red and blue. So, Mr. Brown can have one car that is both red and blue, and another car that is either red or blue, resulting in a total of two cars. Therefore, the statement is not contradictory and can be logically true.

Question  90
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the young youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, the force of his kick combined with the laws of physics caused the ball to travel 10 feet before gravity brought it back down towards him. This is a natural occurrence due to the initial force of the kick and the subsequent pull of gravity, rather than being influenced by the wind or a rope.
Question: A boy had just gotten out of the shower and was getting ready for his prom, shaved and with cologne, and there would be an after-party.

Answer Choices: ['He went crazy with friends in that unnormal party.', 'His beard grows in an amazing speed.', 'He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months." In Alaska, there are periods of continuous daylight and darkness due to its high latitude. During the summer months, the sun does not set for long periods, so it may seem like he was only out for one night but in fact, it was actually several months. This allowed enough time for his beard to grow to a full-grown size.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can." This is because the scenario states that the man fills the cart and walks out without paying, which could suggest theft.

Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.', 'Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside." This is the correct answer because it explains that Brad did not actually jump out of the window, but rather jumped inside the building. Therefore, he did not actually fall from the 22nd floor and was not in danger of sustaining injuries from a fall. This explanation challenges the preconception that Brad attempted suicide by jumping out of the window.

Question  93
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." The reason is that hairless cats, such as Sphinx cats, do not have fur to get wet in the rain, so even though the cat was completely soaked, its hairless skin remained dry. This is a unique characteristic of hairless cats that allows them to endure rainy weather without getting their "hair" wet.

Question  94
Question: Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.', 'Robert burried one silver sphere in the start of the bridge and make sure the location is private enough that no one can find.', 'Robert sank the silver sphere to the bottom of the river and left a mark so that he could find it later.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air." This is because mastering juggling allows him to keep the five silver spheres in the air simultaneously, reducing the effective weight on the bridge to just the weight of his body. This allows him to safely cross the bridge without exceeding its weight limit.

Question  98
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, it reached a height where it defied gravity and started to fall back down towards him. This is known as the principle of projectile motion, where an object is launched into the air and falls back down due to the force of gravity. The ball returning to the boy is not a miracle but a demonstration of basic physics.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the correct answer because it explains why the stones did not cause any harm to the other farmer. Since the stones were actually seeds, they would not have the same impact and injury potential as ordinary stones, thereby preventing harm to the other farmer. This challenges the preconception that the stones were harmful and provides a logical explanation for the lack of harm. Therefore, it is the most fitting answer.
Question: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible? Choose the correct answer choice.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Each player shares the same coach." This is possible because the coach could work with each player at different times or divide their attention among all the players during training or games. It's also possible that the team operates in a way where the coach is able to effectively support and guide all five players simultaneously. This arrangement allows for all players to have a coach while still only having six participants in total.

Question  110
Question: Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.', 'The other farmer was wearing protective clothing or had some form of shield that prevented the stones from causing harm.', 'The stones were small or lacked enough force to cause any significant injury.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: "The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone." This is the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the stones did not cause any harm. If the stones were actually seeds, it makes sense that they would not cause any injury, as they are not hard or heavy like ordinary stones. This answer also aligns with the unexpected outcome of the situation, challenging our preconceptions about the nature of the stones.

Question  111
Question: While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldn’t find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The cat succeeded in avoiding all rain drops.', 'It was a hairless cat.', 'The outside whether is changing frequently.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a hairless cat." This is because a hairless cat would not have any fur to get wet in the rain, so even if it was caught in a downpour, its body would not become wet. Therefore, despite being outside in the rain, the cat's lack of fur would prevent it from getting soaked.

He took his wife home as soon as he realized the solution. How did he recognize his wife among the rosebushes? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that still had her distinctive scent.', 'The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.', 'The husband knew which rose bush was his wife because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is: The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew. This is the correct answer because the husband would have noticed that his wife's rose bush didn't have dew on it, as it had been kept inside the house overnight. This detail would have distinguished her from the other rose bushes.

Question: A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["Woman's sons are too busy to take courses in medical school.", 'The woman\'s sons are all "doctors" in the academic sense ', "Woman's sons learned all their knowledge by themselves.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The woman's sons are all 'doctors' in the academic sense". Despite not attending medical school, they could have earned their doctoral degrees in fields such as philosophy, engineering, or any other academic discipline.

Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the young youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, it gained momentum and height. As it reached its peak, it then began to descend, but gravity slowed its descent and brought it back towards the boy. This is how the ball miraculously returned to him, without the need for any external forces like wind or a rope.
Question: Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through.

Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.', 'The ground outside the building is wet.', 'Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside." This is the correct answer because the prompt states that Lily was "overwhelmed with fatigue" and then opened the balcony door and stepped through. Her exhaustion likely caused her to misperceive the situation, and she actually stepped back inside the apartment instead of off the balcony. This explanation fits the scenario and resolves the apparent contradiction of surviving the fall without any additional factors.

Answer Choices: ['It was day time.\n', 'The driver was paying much attention.', 'The driver is good at listening.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was day time." This is because the man dressed in all black would have been visible to the car's driver during the day, regardless of whether or not the car had its lights on. The driver would have been able to see him due to the natural light of the day, making it unnecessary for the car to have its lights on to detect his presence.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The two men were partners playing doubles." In a doubles tennis match, two players form a team and compete against another team. Each player on the team takes turns serving and returning the ball, so it is conceivable for both players to win an equal number of sets. This scenario would not be possible in a singles match, where only one player can win each set.

Question  115
Question: How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The wind is so strong that the ball doesn't fly so far.", 'There is a rope between the ball and the boy.', 'He kicked it up.\n', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "He kicked it up." When the youngster kicked the soccer ball up into the air, it reached a high enough altitude to experience the effects of gravity and start falling back down towards the ground. The force of the kick combined with gravity allowed the ball to travel the 10 feet distance before returning to the youngster. This explanation aligns with the laws of physics and is the most plausible reason for the ball miraculously returning to him.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The rope wasn't tied to anything so he could reach the food." This is the correct answer because the horse is not limited by the length of the rope since it is not secured to anything. The horse can simply walk to the food without any restriction from the rope.

Question: How was it possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['His horse is named Wednesday.', 'Friday and Saturday are holidays.', 'While in town, he stays in bed for two days.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "His horse is named Wednesday." This is because the days of the week are based on the Gregorian calendar, which is a human construct, and do not necessarily apply to non-human entities such as animals. Therefore, if the cowboy's horse is named Wednesday, it is possible for the cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday, as the name of the horse does not need to follow the human concept of a seven-day week.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." Natives of the Arctic would not eat a penguin's egg because penguins do not live in the Arctic region where they reside. Therefore, it would be impossible for them to have access to penguin eggs. This is the correct answer because it explains the geographical reason why natives of the Arctic would not eat penguin eggs, rather than assuming it has to do with toxicity or cultural reasons.
Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not? Choose the best answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Penguins only live in Antarctica.', "Penguins' eggs are toxic.", 'Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: Let's think step by step. Challenge your preconceptions. What is the best answer?
The best answer is "Penguins only live in Antarctica." This is the most logical reason why natives of the Arctic would not eat a penguin's egg, as it is based on the geographical fact that penguins do not inhabit the Arctic region. This makes it impossible for the Arctic natives to have access to penguin eggs, regardless of whether they are starving or not.

Question  118
Question: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ["The third door, the alligator can be tierd and won't eat people.", 'The first door, the first door is destroyed and you can see the fire in it.', "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.", 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died." This is the correct answer because if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, they would have likely died from starvation. Therefore, it is the closest option to a potential survival as compared to the other two options.
Question: A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Surface tension prevents water from spilling.', 'The glass is too heavy.', 'The glass was filled, but not with water.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The glass was filled, but not with water." This is because the magician likely filled the glass with a substance that looks like water but does not spill easily, such as a clear gel or a similar non-liquid material. This would allow the magician to hold the glass above his head and allow it to fall to the carpet without spilling a single drop.

Question  119
Question: Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The bird.', 'The squirrel.', 'The monkey.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "None of above." This is because the question does not specify that the banana is at the top of the coconut tree - it only mentions that the three animals are racing to the top of the tree. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume that any of the animals will grab the banana first, as it is not explicitly stated to be at the top of the tree. Without this information, it is not possible to determine which animal will grab the banana first.
Question: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl. Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['Bat.', 'Tiger.', 'Owl.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "None of the above." While owls are known for their exceptional night vision, it is a common misconception that they can see in complete darkness. In reality, no animal can see in complete darkness. All vision, whether human or animal, relies on at least minimal levels of ambient light to create images. It is important to challenge preconceptions and seek out accurate information when it comes to animal abilities.

Question  120
Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.', 'The teacher was in an orphanage school.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "The teacher was in an orphanage school." This is because in an orphanage school, it is likely that the children do not have parents to object to the disciplinary approach. This explains why not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class.
Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking? Choose the correct answer choice.
Answer Choices: ['There are too many fish around the ship.', 'There are too many spectators in the harbor.', 'It was a Submarine.', 'None of above.']
Correct Answer: The correct answer is "It was a Submarine." Despite the seemingly normal conditions, the ship was actually a submarine that deliberately submerged. This explains why the ship sank in front of onlookers without a storm or mechanical issue. This revelation challenges the preconception that the ship was a regular surface vessel, leading to the unexpected sinking.
