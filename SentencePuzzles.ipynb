      "Correct Answer:  He was dead and in a coffin.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"he was dead and in a coffin.\" this is because the fifth man was being transported in a coffin, so he did not get wet from the rain. the others may have sped up to avoid getting wet, but the fifth man remained dry as he was not exposed to the rain.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  Because it's in July.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"because it\"s in july.\" this is because independence day is celebrated on july 4th in the united states, which is in the middle of summer. the summer temperatures in july are typically hot, so that\"s why independence day is often so hot.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  He was first floor.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"he was first floor.\" this is because the man leapt out of a window on the first floor, so there was no danger or harm to him. the joke is a play on words, making the reader think he leapt out of a window from a high floor when in reality, he was on the ground level.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"she ordered the pizza for new year\"s day.\" this is because the order came the next year, indicating that she ordered the pizza to be delivered on new year\"s day, which is in the following year. this is a play on words, as the delivery took a year to be completed, but it was still delivered in the following year as per her request.\n",

      "Question:  When the radio abruptly stops playing, Fred is still listening to it. Fred is alone, and no one plays with the radio. After a brief pause, the radio starts up again. How is this possible?\n",
      "Answer Choices:  ['All electricity on the earth is cut down.', 'The car required more electricity to speed up so the radio was cut off.', 'Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.', 'None of above.']\n",
      "Correct Answer:  Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"fred was driving his car through a tunnel.\" when fred drives through a tunnel, the radio signal can be interrupted due to the lack of reception. once he exits the tunnel, the signal will resume and the radio will start playing again. this answer challenges our initial assumption that the radio can only be interrupted by a technical issue, and requires us to consider other possible scenarios.\n",

      "Question:  James was taking a test with 31 questions. He answered to 17 questions. Towards the end of the time, he looked onto other people's choices and answered 7 questions that way. He was so lucky that he remembered how to answer another 7 questions as well. Surprisingly, he got 100% in the test. What did he do with the rest of the questions that he got 100?\n",

      "Correct Answer:  None of above.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"he didn\"t know the answer and just guessed them randomly.\" this is the correct answer because james only answered 17 questions and then guessed on 7, and luckily remembered the answers to another 7. this leaves 17 questions that he didn\"t know the answers to, so the only option left is that he guessed them randomly and happened to get them all right, resulting in a 100% score.\n",

      "Question:  There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?\n",
      "Answer Choices:  [' There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.', \"It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.\", 'It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.', 'None of above.']\n",
      "Correct Answer:  It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"it didn\"t because roosters don\"t lay eggs.\" this is the correct answer because biologically, roosters are male chickens and do not possess the reproductive capability to lay eggs. this explanation is supported by scientific knowledge and is the most logical and accurate reason for why the egg could not have rolled on that side of the triangle-shaped barn top.\n",

      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is: linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption. the other answer choices do not provide a specific and logical reason for the music to stop and start again on its own. this answer choice aligns with the sudden interruption and subsequent restart of the music, which could be caused by turbulence or other interference on the airplane. therefore, this is the correct answer.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  Both the boxers were female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"they only used their heads in the match.\" this is a play on words, as the phrase \"throw a punch\" can also mean to physically punch someone, but in this case, it is taken literally as the boxers only used their heads to butt each other, resulting in one of the boxers getting knocked out after six rounds without throwing any punches.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  The boss called the security to tell them not to let Mark in the office anymore\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"the boss called the security to tell them not to let mark in the office anymore\" because this is a reasonable and professional way for the boss to prevent mark from coming to the office without resorting to violence or involving the police. it also aligns with typical company protocol for handling employee issues.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  It was during the daylight hours.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"the broken headlights can emit a small amount of light, even if it\"s dim.\" this is the correct answer because even though the street lights are not functioning and the town is painted black, the broken headlights would still emit some light, allowing the driver to see the dog in time to avoid hitting it.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  Because they were all married and not single.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"because they were all married and not single.\" this answer is correct because it plays on the double meaning of the word \"single.\" while the question may seem to be referring to the men being alone, it is actually referring to their marital status. this answer is a clever play on words and requires thinking outside the box to solve the riddle.\n",

      "Answer Choices:  [\"The bird's weight is too little that won't affect the bridge to collapse.\", 'Because the wings of the bird can hold up the truck and lift it a little for a while.', 'Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.', 'None of above.']\n",
      "Correct Answer:  Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"the bird\"s weight is too little that won\"t affect the bridge to collapse.\" this is because the weight of the bird is negligible in comparison to the weight capacity of the bridge, so the bird landing on the truck does not affect the bridge\"s ability to hold the weight of the truck. therefore, the bridge does not collapse.\n",

      "Correct Answer:  They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.\n",
      "Predicted Answer:  the correct answer is \"people may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.\" this is because most people celebrate their birthdays every year, so the number of birthdays they have depends on how long they live. if they live to be 80 years old, they would have 80 birthdays. if they live to be 100 years old, they would have 100 birthdays. therefore, the number of birthdays a person has on average depends on their lifespan.\n",

One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife?\n",
